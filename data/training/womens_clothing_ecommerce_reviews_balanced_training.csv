"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",0,Jackets
Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this.,0,Fine gauge
I felt like a 12 year old wearing my big sister's dress. it's a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large  hitting below my knees. the top part fits my large  34g chest nicely but it becomes a wide a-line through the hips. the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesn't flow softly over the body. the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward.  i love the black and white stripes. very striking. would love a top in these colors and fabric ,1,Dresses
Very happy with the fit  sizing  and look of these shorts.,1,Shorts
I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!,1,Lounge
"These pants are my new ""go to"" . i am 5'6"" 122# and the 25 fits perfectly. they do give a little.     lots of colors to choose from. i have the washed blue and am thinking i need to get more colors!",1,Pants
I love this sweater! it's vivid  soft and high quality. it's a little shorter than i'd normally go for  but it will look great with a mid to high rise jean. it runs true to size and meant to be roomy. the red is very vibrant.,1,Sweaters
My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on  and how they fit  and she brought this dress in  with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug  highlight every bump  and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.,1,Dresses
I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota  so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is  the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets  which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me  and i ordere,1,Sweaters
This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom  but i feel like it will stretch a little over time  it is also very long which i love  because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great  i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct  if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted  size down  but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo,1,Knits
I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!,0,Blouses
This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.,0,Dresses
I have been searching around for new and unique clothes to wear to work. this top is cute  comfortable  and well made. these are all qualities that i look for when purchasing clothes. also the shirt is flattering for the stomach if you are like me and had a baby.,1,Knits
I was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store. i'm normally a size 2 but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms  so found a size 4 to be just right. it's longer and a bit wider than the size 2 everywhere else  but given the design  i thought it was fine. the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever. if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders  sizing up is a must. lengthwise  it fit me like it does on the model.

Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right  not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen  very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.,1,Jackets
Definitely size up...possibly two sizes. i can often wear an xs and the s is skin tight on me. other than that  it's a nice neutral piece.,1,Knits
Great dress for a full figure. forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests  athletic vests  sweaters  jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots  dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi,1,Dresses
"This is as pretty in person as it is online  good quality (except one item i'll get to)  and fits true to size. i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and the medium fit great in this top.  i almost kept this shirt...so close  i had it on a hanger  but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online  but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on  my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)...",0,Knits
Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.,0,Dresses
This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!,0,Pants
What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....  the sleeves are very long and very boxy... i have no idea the condition of this on store  but came with damages on sleeves also  we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that  i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!  dissipointed!!!! ;(,0,Sweaters
The material is different than i expected  but i like it a lot. the dress is extremely tight fitting  i will be returning it if i can't figure something out. i'm a 36d and wear a 6  very very restricting in the chest/shoulder area. unfortunately  it may just not be designed for my body type. getting the dress on was for sure one of my hardest workouts...and i crossfit. oh  and the bow does not come off at all  so good luck with that. the red color is gorgeous  i hope it works out.,1,Dresses
"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.",0,Dresses
"As soon as i saw this dress  i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.  the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.  i am 5'0""  110  and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to",1,Dresses
Love the fit  i purchased a medium and like the room it gives  not snug against my body. the waistline cut is my favorite. purchased three colors  black  white and mustard. all are very flattering for my age (60) and i wear with my skinny jeans!,1,Knits
So this is a great tee  problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.,0,Knits
I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.,0,Dresses
Fun blouse for spring with enough details to make it unique and dressy. very comfortable fit. banded bottom which is loose enough to still be comfortable. dresses up a pair of jeans quite nicely!,1,Knits
I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.,0,Blouses
Love the blue color  different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff  but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.,1,Knits
"The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly  the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly  as i stood looking in the mirror  the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went.",0,Dresses
"I've been eyeing this dress for a while now. i decided to purchase it in the rose color  which has absolutely beautiful embroidery. here's why i will most likely return this dress: i'm 5'7"" and it is very short on me (almost like a long shirt)  it is extremely roomy  so it doesn't flatter me in any way. if it belt it  it gets even shorter  and the embroidery gets a bit lost in the folds. i'm sad to return it  but i will wait for the next wow piece rather than have this sit in my closet.",1,Dresses
These are super comfortable. i love feeling like i'm wearing pajamas in public but being properly dressed  although i wear them around the house often  too. i don't regret spending this much money on these pants  it was worth it since i'm wearing them so much.,1,Lounge
I loved the dog on this sweater  and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on  like others  i did find it to be itchy  but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are  so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...,0,Sweaters
"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1  113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you",1,Fine gauge
I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.,0,Dresses
I really was excited to get this dress. the design is great. very nice quality. it does seem to run small on me in the booty/belly area. that or it is just tighter than my liking. overall it is a nice dress. i plan to get a mint cardigan to top it off and a thin cognac leather belt.,1,Dresses
I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good  not too right or lose. i took a size medium  which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me  also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.,1,Knits
Love!!!! i was super hesitant to try this dress on  it didn't look great online or on the hanger. but it looked great on! it has a very boho/70s/vintage feel. i am curvy  and it looked fabulous.,1,Dresses
This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!,1,Blouses
This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.,0,Dresses
"Based on other reviews i had no doubt this dress would be perfect.  it truly is a work of art  however it just wasn't ""me"" when i tried it on.  i'm sure for others it will be perfect.  my biggest issues were the sheerness of the top portion  which is obvious in the photos.  i was hoping it would be less obvious in person.  also the elbows of the dress were tight  so it was difficult to bend my arms  and i have pretty slender arms.",1,Dresses
I loved the fit  color and style  but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.,0,Skirts
I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!,1,Blouses
The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.,0,Dresses
Yes  it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique  chic and modern. definitely worth the price  especially on sale. very nice quality fabric.,1,Sweaters
I love this dress. it fits perfect (i'm 5 3  108 and ordered xs)i think the off white stone color is true to the picture. i will be wearing this dress as my wedding dress for our small intimidate wedding. i can't wait.,1,Dresses
Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.,1,Swim
Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,0,Shorts
Beautiful and very versatile dress. extremely forgiving for post baby bodies  while stylish and classy.,1,Dresses
This is a beautiful dress and it was hard to let it go but  unfortunately  because the fabric is a little stiff  it accentuated my curvy back side in a bad way. it will definitely look great on someone with a smaller bottom. i tried the xs and did not experience the issues that other reviewers mentioned  such as the large arm holes.,1,Dresses
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric  though poly  is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt  size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",1,Pants
Fit  length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.,1,Skirts
This shirt fits beautifully  though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft  and the look classic and feminine.,1,Blouses
This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.,1,Knits
This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.,1,Blouses
I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out,0,Dresses
This cardigan's color is great. it goes with a lot of items surprisingly. the fit is a little large/loose  but that's nice for being able to wear various shirts underneath. i've received lots of compliments on it.,1,Knits
The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops  but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly  but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price  it is worth tailoring.,1,Blouses
I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.,0,Legwear
Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!,1,Fine gauge
I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.,1,Knits
The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.,0,Knits
I ordered my usually size  xs  and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.,0,Knits
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,0,Dresses
This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large  as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite  but this one is a return.,0,Knits
I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.,0,Pants
It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.,0,Sweaters
I got this cute tunic in-store in the coral color during a 25% off sale items promotion. it's a fun  quirky piece with mixed fabrics  and can be worn alone with leggings or layered with a jacket  skinny jeans and boots. a versatile piece  it does have a few issues. i found he armhole to be slightly large on my petite frame  even in the xs; not a deal-breaker  but a bit of a pet peeve for me. i'll probably end up wearing cami under it most of the time  since the top knit portion is a somewhat loo,1,Knits
I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.,0,Dresses
I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,0,Shorts
This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors  pattern  and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small  and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs  and the body of it was just right  but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses  but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were,0,Dresses
"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2""  103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well  but instead of looking slouchy and cool  it just looked too big. so  back it goes.",0,Blouses
"I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.    i'm an hourglass shape  and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest  but this top drapes down nicely. however  loose shirts like this aren't my style  so i belt this at my waist  and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider)  and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small ",1,Knits
This t-shirt is very casual  so it is perfect for everyday use.   touch of textile is comfortable  so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt.   although stripe is a simple design  it does not limit your choise of fashion  so it can go with almost anything.   just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.,1,Knits
It sits a little short but works great for a jacket when you don't want to have a big winter coat when going out.,1,Sweaters
This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in,0,Sweaters
I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.,1,Dresses
"Like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also  the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly  it's going back!",0,Blouses
"I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out  but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7"" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small  so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection ",1,Blouses
The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.,1,Knits
I love this peasant dress! i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy boots/frye jane boots  black tights and silver sparkly earrings -no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke. the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape  so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined  has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff  and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have,1,Dresses
Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.,0,Knits
I don't normally write reviews  but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus  they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5  135 and medium is perfect.,1,Knits
"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace  color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite  for reference  5'2""  24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.",0,Blouses

Lovey top in the photos. however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3  118lbs  36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.,0,Knits
I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious  wonderful for fall or winter  and the gold  gray  and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus  pockets! however  the midi length did not work for me  despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length  just above the knee. i'm not,0,Skirts
I loved this at first sight  and ordered it in a 10  12  and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra  so usually braless is not an option  but this actually offers enough support. and  if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it.     it's super flattering  and really fun to wear out day or night.,1,Dresses
This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.,1,Dresses
I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite. super soft with just the right amount of stretch. they keep their fit and don't stretch out. the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering. i'm petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable.,1,Jeans
This is a nice dress  but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .,0,Dresses
This is really cute online  but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder  but the material is very thin  and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.,0,Knits

There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a,0,Dresses
I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,0,Shorts
The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty  though,0,Dresses
"Everyone has said it  so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great  soft  flattering top. i bought two  one in white and one in black  and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up  and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits.

I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper.  i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item.,1,Shorts
"I love the cut of these pants! i'm very curvy and the high waist and wide leg is perfect for me. these hang off the hips beautifully. i'm 5'2"" and the petite is perfect with heels. i didn't have to hem them. the one drawback is that they get very static clingy which is frustrating. i wear them with a cream tie blouse and wedges. they're really comfortable.",1,Pants
Upon opening this top  i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall  but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin  and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots  but i love this shirt. i got the xs  which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s  but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.,1,Knits
"I ordered this in a s (for reference  i am 5'7""  128-130 lb  32dd  with a 27"" waist)  and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest  but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs  but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model  but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric  which has a jus",1,Knits

"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger  so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy  5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving  fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models  or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!",1,Dresses
This dress is so unique  and is high quality. it came nicely packaged  and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events  and it fits the bill. i wore it once  and received many compliments. the only issue  is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem  but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great  so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.,1,Lounge

I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,0,Blouses

I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,0,Blouses

I was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews  i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small [catch on the hips] in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer  too. the back is fine because it's longer. it's definitely wearable though. i wouldn't recommend it for a work function if you're a bit taller. despite all of that  i really do like dress. it's a new favorite. i ordered the blue --- love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it,1,Dresses

Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up  mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all  so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband  but i don't think that can be prevented.,1,Pants

Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,0,Dresses

I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they,0,Dresses

So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.,0,Blouses
Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.,0,Sweaters

Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas  so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect  since the colors aren't look too summery  but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy  but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops  this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.,1,Blouses

I completely agree with the other reviewer. this sweater is so much prettier in person. i've been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it. the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves  but i also have short arms. the fur isn't overwhelming and i love the pockets. i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not (it's 26% wool). i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath.,1,Sweaters
I love the cold shoulder trend  and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue  which is really more like a very light mint green. however  i think the material is pretty thin (though soft)  and the keyhole sleeve area  right by the twist  is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small  but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds  32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price  thou,0,Knits

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.,0,Dresses

"Light weight and cotton  great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me  but they are not falling down so far. also  if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black  you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer.",1,Blouses
Ordered this dress online  and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist  but for the most part  the dress fit very well and was very flattering  may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips  and,1,Dresses
I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up  you'll love it...,1,Knits
This is such a classy  elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color  but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.,1,Fine gauge

This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.,0,Dresses

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned,0,Dresses

This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?,0,Dresses

I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,0,Jackets

I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin,0,Dresses

So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well  xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both.,1,Outerwear

I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and don't show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,1,Knits
I thought this was a pretty and unique top. the material looks and feels like a basic t-shirt made into a striking fitted top. this isn't apparent in the online pictures: the side seams are slitted open nearly up to the waist  so it is a bit revealing. my only problem with this shirt was that the bottom part flared out too much away from my body  and there is a lot of material there  so i wasn't sure if i could get it tailored to look good on me.,1,Knits

I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress,1,Dresses
I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon,0,Jackets

I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.,0,Jackets
I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant!   for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.  the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one,0,Knits
I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium  size 6 around 5' 8  and i chose the m/l  which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric  which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care  i am exchanging for another one in small.,1,Jackets
Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans  leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different,1,Outerwear
I am petite and ordered size small  and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice  but in terms of the waist and length size  both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all  and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item  unfortunately.,0,Lounge
The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.,0,Dresses

I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great  i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest,1,Dresses

If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,0,Intimates
I bought this coat 5 years ago and every fall/winter  i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn  but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it,1,Sweaters
I love clothing that has little surprises  and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is,1,Lounge
I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much  but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas  it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.,1,Blouses
"It's not totally apparent in all of the photos  but this dress does have a very noticeable a-symmetric hemline. i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is ""forgiving"" and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame. if you are truly an hourglass (small waist  larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight ) this dress is a poor choice. the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip  and the a-symmetry of this particular hemline not only draws",0,Dresses

This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy  not black. very dark navy  yes. still  not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top  and i can wear it right now.,1,Knits
Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses
I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work  and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad  but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small  or xs in most shirts  and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though  and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.,0,Knits
The price was worth the splurge  free shipping and a special discount helped. the minute i laid my eyes on this sweater i was hooked. light  airy weight and that handmade texture make the overall design something special. this is the kind of sweater that has enduring style. the big kangaroo pockets scared me a little  which i have determined to be not a distraction after trying it on.,1,Sweaters

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses

I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot  the color is highly versatile  it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm  and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan  likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to,1,Sweaters

The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.,1,Sweaters

This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,0,Skirts

This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.,1,Lounge
I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.,0,Blouses

This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!,0,Dresses
I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright  but once i slipped it on  it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted  i'm s little bottom heavy  so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.,0,Dresses
This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that  i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.,1,Sleep
The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length  style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants  i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!,1,Shorts

This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big. this went back  will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp.,0,Knits
I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived  i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store!,0,Blouses
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,1,Pants
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.,0,Blouses
I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love  love  love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy  but still fits very nicely. what a great buy  hope to see more of this style again.,1,Knits
This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering  a bit special  all in all nice. but the white is see through  and the green somehow reads much more casual  at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.,1,Blouses
I think of tracy reese as running small  and usually size up  but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage  so you need the right bra.,1,Pants

I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.,0,Sweaters

I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors  weight  fabric. love. love. love.   unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite  which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end  i had to pass.,0,Dresses

These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans  totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice  so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.,1,Jeans

The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur,0,Dresses
This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.,0,Knits
The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.,0,Dresses
I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding  and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.,1,Dresses

I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper  thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere  so i was happy about that. still  it is made with slub,1,Dresses
This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide  it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves  ruffle) are beautiful  unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day  which fit nicely  for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size  even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.,0,Blouses
This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.,0,Blouses

I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,1,Skirts

I love this dress. as a petite woman  it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself  it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus,1,Dresses

It's impossible to tell  but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman  with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in  but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer  on both sides  which gives the dress movement  even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it,1,Dresses

I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.,0,Dresses

I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes  this is a cute shirt  if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but  my arms aren't even big  and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(,0,Blouses
I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white  which you can plainly see in the picture  but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.,0,Dresses

Wow  i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank  i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy.   would totally buy different colors if it came in others  but i'm no,1,Blouses

I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.,0,Blouses

Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.,0,Knits

This dress is perfect for wearing in autumn (and beyond)! it will look great with casual flats or sneakers while it's still warm outside and it will be very stylish and cozy with a denim jacket and boots when it's cooler outside. it runs large in the skirted portion of the dress  like last season's similar floral dresses by this brand. the dress is a medium weight rayon and is not lined; some people might want to wear a slip or half slip or wear leggings with this dress for modesty. as for the c,1,Dresses

I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown,1,Jeans

The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately  this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous  which is never a good feeling. i recommend  but only for tall  slim types with a small bust.,1,Blouses

I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning,0,Skirts

If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses
At first  i thought this sweater might be too boxy  but fastened at the waist  it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing  and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.  but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas  and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.,1,Sweaters

As most other reviewers stated  the skirt does run a bit large and long. however  it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!,1,Skirts

This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however  when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition  though i ordered a size medium  it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad  i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are  go for it  but get a size smaller than you normally would!,0,Sweaters

I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however  when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were  with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well  just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.,0,Sweaters

This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.,0,Pants

"I tried this top on in-store in red and lavender. i love it! yes  it is big  but it is still really cute. if you are between sizes  go down a size. i am 5'5"" 34b and went with an xs in the red. it appears to fit in the front but looks larger in the back  which i think the other reviewer was getting at.",1,Knits

I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately  it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and  it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly  it is going back.,0,Dresses
I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing  but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.,1,Dresses
The dress is very cute  probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee  which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin  but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.,1,Dresses

I probably have 10 pairs of pilcro jeans and pants and most of the jeans are the skinny fit. i wanted something that wasn't a skinny fit so i thought i would try these straight fit jeans thinking they would be skinny but they also wouldn't be loose. just got them today and when i tried them on they were tighter then the skinny jeans i just took off. i guess i agree with the other reviewers that they fit like a glove. so if that's what you're looking for these will be great.,1,Jeans

I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.,0,Knits
I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber  ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.,0,Blouses
Love these pilcro jeans  my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs  they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist  not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!,1,Jeans

Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes  you might want to size down. if i did order a small  the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer  so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w,1,Blouses

The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,0,Jeans

I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,1,Dresses

Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.,0,Dresses

I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small  and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked.,1,Dresses

This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle  stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned  it is thick  but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it  making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s  60s  or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look  you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says  this is a piece that would neve,1,Skirts

This dress is so beautiful  the color is even more vibrant in person  a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm  which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top  look at the back view photo online  you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view  but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer,1,Dresses

These are the cutest prints  but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt  which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless  both my appropriate size  which i still felt was too short  and the size up  which hit at a flattering spot  were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size  the shirt runs very wide.,0,Blouses
I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans  and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me)  but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down  and not just at the top  something i appreciated. those buttons  however  are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'4 130lbs  often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one  which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were,1,Fine gauge

I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it  it's the cutest suit ever.,1,Swim

I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky!,0,Lounge

Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however  i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips  smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still  i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c)  but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.,0,Blouses
I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible! i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare. i get compliments on it every where i go. it's flattering  comfy and it's a one piece that doesn't make me feel frumpy. buy this suit!,1,Swim
I wanted to love it - the color is great  the embroidery pretty  but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.,0,Knits

The top runs small  it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l  it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy  good looking  and slimming top. i love it!!,1,Knits

I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.,0,Trend
Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they  firstly  aren't eloise like i assumed they would be  and secondly  that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure  but i'm,0,Sleep

I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however  i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much  but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.,0,Dresses
I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.,0,Knits
I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.,1,Lounge
I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites  so i tried a large  and it was tight in the bust  but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.,1,Knits
Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion  and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy  but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.,1,Knits
I love the cut of this top  it flares out nicely  and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail  not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice  i didn't try petite or xxs  just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good.

I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3  32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.,1,Sleep
The front material is soft and cozy  but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit  like long john material  very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it  only tank top. other than that  it's a great deal,1,Sleep
I love this top-it fits true to size  hits at the low hip so its not too short  and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans  freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots  and a glittery silver necklace  but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt  tights and boots  and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm,1,Blouses
While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.,0,Jeans
Wonderful dress! very comfortable and great fit! received numerous compliments whenever i wear it.,1,Dresses
The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it. this is also pretty warm. it's not a down jacket  but it's as least as warm as a sweatshirt. it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion. i'm 5'6 155 lbs and went with the large  which fits well. i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception  but i can't really fault the jacket for that  it's true to the style.,1,Jackets
I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,0,Dresses
This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.,1,Dresses
"My retailer location only had the blue option  which i found to be very appealing and better in person for the following reasons: __________ pros: - lighter knit like others mentioned. - the blue is a deep blue with threads of shimmery black that give it a more elegant touch while still being casual. i didn't see the grey  so i cannot compare the two differences  but i found the blue color lovely. - this looks much better in person! - it sat well on my tall frame of 5'9""  36 c  wide hips  and hour",1,Knits

You won't break the bank with this cute tee. loved that it's not a thin fabric. the variation in the stripes adds interest  too. i ordered a large  my regular size  and it fit well. i returned because it was a bit on the long side on my short frame  the colors didn't suit me and i need long sleeve tees now that we're heading into the colder months.,1,Knits

3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0,Intimates
Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,0,Pants
I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,0,Swim
I had to have this jacket! looks much better in person. i bought the navy color. the fit is great. it has a flowy bottom and is unstructured. i wear a dark navy t shirt or cami underneath. great with jeans and over the knee boots or booties. its a bit heavy and bulky to wear under a coat.,1,Sweaters

If you're tall  this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy  so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large  but not on a good way. in other words  this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all  not worth it.,0,Dresses

Really nice  substantial  fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size  maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes  go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price  which is why i dropped one star  i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.,1,Outerwear

This top is adorable and looked pretty on  but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped  but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off  even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped  so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot  but i didn't,1,Blouses

I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have,0,Pants
"When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning  it was just so elegant and the details are perfection.

I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy  but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement  but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious.,1,Dresses

I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!,0,Knits
"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78  it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?)  but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b)  so it did nothing for me..  also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green",0,Knits

I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium  so thought i'd be safe order the medium  which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper.,1,Knits
"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it! had to send back!",0,Dresses

These are very well-made jeans  the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist  and they make my butt look great. however  these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing  but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy  then buy your regular size.,0,Jeans

"Contrary to the first review  i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow  like on the model  but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",1,Blouses

"Beautifully constructed tank--but the bodice isn't fitted and hangs straight down on me--perhaps better for a full-figured individual (i'm 5' 8""  34b  120lbs and the xs had no shape on sides). could've been longer too. size of armholes is perfect though (often they gap/show bra).",1,Knits
Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent  colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down  worn with a number of various styles - jeans  dress pants  skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit  the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small  but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate,1,Knits
This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me  even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like,1,Knits

This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.,0,Trend

I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy  but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress  yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through  however  for a texas summer  that defeats the point of a loose  easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.,1,Dresses

Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.,0,Blouses
The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.,1,Knits
The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,0,Fine gauge
This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference  i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit!

I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders  so if you are broad in that area  it might not work for you. overall  love!,1,Blouses
This shirt is semi-fitted. i like it because it is not boxy but not overly tight. it is not heavy even though it is a sweatshirt material. i wish the neck was a bit higher but i will wear a tee under it. the back is really cute.   it is different and i like that.,1,Knits

Ok  so by now  we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce  i am 5'7  about 120  and xs was the best fit.  but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low  and it survived just fine!,1,Knits

I thought the design of this dress was distinctive  and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on  but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive  there is something special about the dress.,1,Dresses

I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately  it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger  busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine  but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.,0,Dresses

Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters

Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!,1,Dresses
I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller  slimmer bod,0,Knits

I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's,0,Pants
I like this shirt because it can be worn for dressy or casual. i like the weight although i wish it was just a tad less see-through. i can get by without wearing a tank under but i usually feel like i have to wear one. i like the link. i feel like it runs just a little large. i love the length of the sleeves and the detail/cut of the sleeve. i like the colors on the shirt too. it's a good  versatile addition to my wardrobe!,1,Knits

This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me  but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size  with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls  but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais,1,Pants
I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.,0,Jeans

I like this sweater but i'm not in love. the rib knit on the sleeves are too form fitting (not restrictive) on my chubby arms so it doesn't look flattering when i wear long sleeves. i do appreciate the mixed patterns and the soft moss colorway  it's very pretty together. i purchased the medium petite and the length looks good. maybe i need the large because of my body type. i'll give it another chance when my paquerette gets here,1,Sweaters

This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust  shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top,1,Blouses

This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.,0,Dresses

I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.,0,Dresses

Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,0,Outerwear

I received this dress in both colors (oatmeal and blue) for christmas  and i love them! they are super comfortable and great with leggings. i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church. i am 5'10 and 140 lbs and i got the small. it fits true to size. i would definitely recommend!,1,Sleep
The lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up. you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords  as well as a fitted skirt. the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight  nor too loose. i usually wear a small and the small fit the best. i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit  the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms.,1,Fine gauge
I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look (bomber). feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a t-shirt  or over a dress. lovely on every note. fit: i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp.

I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and  yikes  right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue  they were just as pictured/expected.,0,Jeans
Tried both colors....gorgeous  but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is.

I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,1,Outerwear

These pants overall are very comfortable  but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short  and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter  so if you have long legs or like more draping  you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh  a bit puffy  i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality  and cute design.,1,Lounge

I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors  and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season  this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in  but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy  flowy  and the white version is sheer  but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!,1,Blouses

I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.,0,Sweaters
What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem  it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.,0,Knits

"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7""",0,Knits

First  i absolutely love this dress  and i was super excited when it arrived today. i sized up as other reviewers recommended  and the dress fits perfectly. however  when i zipped the dress up  the zipper came apart in the center. going up another size would make the dress fit improperly  so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper.,0,Dresses
Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.,0,Pants
I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.,0,Fine gauge

Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.,0,Blouses
I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap,0,Dresses
I'm a short girl  but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me  i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad  which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still  it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.,0,Knits
I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes  it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress  with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others  the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn't real,0,Dresses

I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0,Dresses

I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and,0,Dresses
I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine  but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but  i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me  still fitted at the waist (27inches)  but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.,1,Jackets
The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.,0,Dresses

The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.,0,Dresses

This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat,0,Knits

I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,1,Knits
I ordered this dress in navy for fall  and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small  and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy  making it more modest  but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower,1,Dresses

I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,0,Jackets

I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling,1,Trend

Love this top  looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short  so for me the high waist pants were a must  but if you don't mind showing your belly  then it would be cute with anything  the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.,1,Knits

I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on  i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!,1,Jeans
I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.,1,Jackets

I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.,0,Skirts
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.,0,Dresses

This dress is lovely fabric  generaly nicely tailored  but weirdly large around armholes  which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.   dress was generally a a bit too big on top  oddly both too long in the torso  and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12  fairly busty but not extremely  and with a slightly short torso  which is party the problem (th,0,Dresses
I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well  so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded,0,Knits

There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect  the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening  and the cut (length  wide straps  and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure  skin color  and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...,1,Layering

I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,0,Shorts

I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate  it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t  and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.,1,Knits
I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though  but you will need a cami with it.,1,Knits
Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.,0,Blouses
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,0,Blouses

Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.,0,Knits
Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color.

The first surprise is that in person  the material is actually kind of woolen? at least  i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out  but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic  so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me  as the regular version was longer tha,0,Skirts

I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun  nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!,1,Blouses

I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.,0,Knits

Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.,0,Knits

After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,0,Jackets

Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it  of course  was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.  that said  i love the suit and am going to try in one and 2 siz,1,Swim
I love most pure and good clothing pieces  mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts  but i is very  very long and straight up and down. fyi: i have a boyish figure  having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back  so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out,1,Lounge

This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you don't mind layering or your bra peeking through  it's still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this wasn't available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long  not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on,0,Dresses

I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.,0,Dresses
Love it! cute  flattering  and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.    the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock)  and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it.,1,Sweaters

I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,0,Jackets
This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined  so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line  not sheath  but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest  so if you're between sizes in the bust  i'd order up. that said  a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4  120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.,1,Dresses

Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late  this brand has really fallen all over the board for me  but this top had the right fabric  fit  and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!,1,Blouses

Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.,0,Blouses

First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,0,Fine gauge

I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality  and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray)  which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size  it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8'  and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer  but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look.,1,Blouses

The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter  but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd)  however  i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also  the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit,1,Dresses

Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.,0,Knits

This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however  the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however  the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short  but have a little wider shoulders  so  perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down  so  i had to do some cont,0,Dresses

This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey but well worth it.,1,Skirts

"It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made  has a fun pattern  and fits great.  i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.  the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile",1,Sweaters

Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,0,Jeans

This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.,0,Knits
This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also  i am between a size small and medium  i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big  so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a,1,Knits

I bought the black motif  the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful  but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos  but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!,1,Blouses
This is great  lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down  or on a breezy day. it's sheer  so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model  which i like.,1,Layering
I know this is labeled under activewear  but the fabric is a dream  it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl  and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!,1,Lounge

I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.,0,Fine gauge
These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold  green  and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs   5 foot 7  and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out  but i haven't found that to be a real problem.,1,Jeans

I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites  i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.     i'm 5'6  160 lbs  and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length  waist and bust fit perfectly.,1,Pants

I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt  but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.,0,Fine gauge

Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one,0,Blouses

I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.,0,Dresses

I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.,0,Jeans
This is a good basic casual skirt  and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts  but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8  which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though  even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy  and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.,1,Skirts

The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts

Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.,0,Blouses
This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still,0,Fine gauge

I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short ,0,Dresses
This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,0,Knits
Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg  have plenty of length (i'm 5'6  and there is a good inch of extra length)  but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though  but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey  probably a size 31 in jeans right now  and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality,1,Lounge
I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,1,Blouses

This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size  but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.,1,Knits

This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.,0,Knits
Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great  comfortable fit  but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.,0,Blouses
I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big  boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.,0,Knits
I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would've maybe fit me in this top. it's so billowy and not fitted at all.,0,Blouses
Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen)  but i still think it'll go with a lot.,1,Jackets
I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite,1,Dresses
Soft  comfortable  flattering - great for spring  summer  fall  and wear a tight black long-sleeved tee underneath for winter! not form-fitting  even if you size down.,1,Dresses
I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!,1,Jeans
"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s  but sized down to xs  and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer  i also can't wait to layer it",1,Knits
So cute! i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it. very comfortable. i ordered a petite l and it's a little big. i usually buy the petite m  but due to the under slip i wasn't sure.,1,Dresses
Like one of the previous reviewers  when my jacket arrived  it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic  medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally  know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy  but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs  but it was s,0,Outerwear
The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.,0,Lounge
This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.,1,Jackets
Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.,1,Jackets
"I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it  however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever  though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me  and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky  which it does mention. maybe a little expensive  but i did use a coupon.",1,Swim
As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back,0,Dresses
"Sadly  this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11"" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.",1,Blouses
"Pros: soft  quality top  true to size  and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder    reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up  and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.    i'm 5'6""  normally a medium/8  and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures  so as an hour-glass shaped gal  i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a",0,Knits
