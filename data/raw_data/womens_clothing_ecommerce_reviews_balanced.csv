"Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3""  ordered a s)  this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back.",0,Dresses
I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.    it is a very unique piece and high quality; however  i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes  and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i wouldn't want to size down...),0,Dresses
I wanted so badly to love this dress  but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated  and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though  the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning  but alas will be returning.,0,Dresses
I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute  but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.,0,Knits
"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house  so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews  it runs big in some areas  something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also  the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry  i think of pink or red  this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we",0,Knits
The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.,0,Dresses
I really wanted to like this top. in fact  i have put it on to wear several times then opted for something else. so i'm thinking it has to go back. for one thing  the yoke part is sewn onto the bottom so the stripes are crooked...that bothers me. i may get it in the white instead because i do like the style. i just wish it were in a solid color. but try it - it might work for you!,0,Knits
This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however  the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.,0,Dresses
"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",0,Pants
"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",0,Blouses
Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!,0,Knits
I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.,0,Dresses
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.,0,Dresses
I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,0,Blouses
The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,0,Knits
Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,0,Jackets
I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one. unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.,0,Swim
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",0,Sweaters
"This dress looked so cute on the model  but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style  rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4""  i wish this would have worked  but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style  this could be s",0,Dresses
I love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn't seem to have helped.,0,Jeans
"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!",0,Pants
I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!,0,Knits
I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress,0,Dresses
"I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however  after just wearing them twice  the threads of the leaves are fraying  and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone  or at least much less ""white"" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad  they were l",0,Pants
I too will be returning this sweater. love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.,0,Knits
I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute  but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.,0,Knits
I ordered my usually size  xs  and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.,0,Knits
I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.,0,Sweaters
Was super excited to try this on  but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.,0,Dresses
Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!,0,Knits
Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy  i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.,0,Blouses
Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid  but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned ,0,Knits
I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.,0,Pants
I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.,0,Knits
It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady,0,Knits
The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.,0,Jackets
"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",0,Intimates
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.,0,Knits
Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.,0,Fine gauge
Ordered size 12  it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long  hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color  nice fabric  great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.,0,Dresses
I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.,0,Knits
The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return,0,Dresses
I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.,0,Knits
"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily  my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol",0,Knits
I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.,0,Knits
Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.,0,Pants
This shirt is comfortable and looks just like the picture. my only complaint is that it is quite boxy so not very flattering. the colors and details are great. the material is good quality and thick. if you are looking for a light t-shirt this is not for you,0,Knits
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.,0,Dresses
This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.,0,Jackets
Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,0,Fine gauge
I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!,0,Knits
Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.,0,Dresses
As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back,0,Dresses
"First  let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1""  138lbs  34dd  30  38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve  esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6.     first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips.     the bad: surprisingly  the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f",0,Dresses
I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose  fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small  5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.,0,Knits
I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.,0,Jackets
"I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3"" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be",0,Pants
I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.,0,Legwear
"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.",0,Sweaters
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.,0,Sweaters
Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.,0,Dresses
In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.,0,Knits
I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.,0,Dresses
The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.,0,Skirts
Nice fabric  very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.,0,Dresses
I usually follow the boho look  and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be. the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas  and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting. i n,0,Dresses
I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.,0,Knits
"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",0,Blouses
"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.",0,Blouses
If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses
I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.,0,Dresses
I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly  though  it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos  which was ok  but i had to return it because of the size.,0,Outerwear
Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.,0,Dresses
I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short ,0,Dresses
Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!,0,Jackets
"Unfortunately this top is shirt-length  and i'm only 5'4"". needs to be about 6"" longer. made of sweatshirt material  which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.",0,Lounge
This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.,0,Dresses
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest,0,Dresses
So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,0,Layering
The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are  so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.,0,Dresses
"I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen  appliquã©  pockets  raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium  for reference i am 5'4""  135 and usually wear a six or a small.",0,Dresses
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,0,Shorts
"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite.",0,Dresses
These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.,0,Jeans
I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length  but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless  billowy and wide  which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment  by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward  but i decided to return the dress.,0,Dresses
This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.,0,Blouses
"I was so excited to get this top... and while it is soooo amazingly soft  i still could not keep it. i must admit that i am only 5'2""  so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this... but i felt like a matador  which is definitely not what i was going for... maybe if your tall and lean  this would work.  but for me  no way.",0,Knits
I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl   wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full   a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.,0,Dresses
Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca,0,Knits
I had high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.,0,Dresses
I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on  the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.   if you have a tiny head and pencil a,0,Blouses
"I'm petite  and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy  the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here  but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall  not a great sweater.",0,Sweaters
This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.,0,Knits
I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole  it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea  but not practical  even without a hole =),0,Dresses
This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp,0,Dresses
This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!,0,Sweaters
I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge ,0,Swim
I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.,0,Blouses
Very soft material  length is great  a little more loose than i would have liked.,0,Knits
Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.,0,Pants
I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.,0,Knits
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.,0,Knits

Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,0,Outerwear
This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters
This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,0,Dresses
It's like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it. very sad to return this.,0,Trend

The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.,0,Trend

I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.,0,Swim

For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir,0,Skirts

This dress is pretty  but there were a few things i disliked.    the overdress is fairly shapeless; however  the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer  the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress  the slip  and the lace. finally  as other reviewers have shared  the buttons are not functional  and the v-neck of the overdress is deep.     i recommend trying the dress,0,Dresses

This is such a beautiful top with pretty  vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine  the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back  with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!  so sad to have to return this one.,0,Knits

This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!,0,Dresses

First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,0,Fine gauge

This dress isn't as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are  it doesn't look great on me. for reference  i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason  the high neckline isn't flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.,0,Dresses

The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts

For starters  the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top  but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top  the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.,0,Blouses

I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h,0,Blouses

I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!,0,Blouses
Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.,0,Knits

The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater  but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down  but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine  but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.,0,Lounge

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses

I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes  2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt,0,Skirts

This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.,0,Dresses

The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned,0,Dresses

This dress didn't work for me for several reasons  but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms  which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.    on the plus side  the fabric feels great  and it hangs well.,0,Dresses
This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.,0,Dresses

Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady  but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips  even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try,0,Blouses

I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,0,Jackets
"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally  i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly  the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",0,Shorts
Took another reviewer's advice and sized up to an xl. unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasn't attractive. love the color. and it's dreamy soft. the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms. my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy (it clings) and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large. sadly returned.,0,Dresses
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,0,Knits

I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!,0,Blouses

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock,0,Knits

Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,0,Sleep

Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,0,Blouses

"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",0,Dresses
I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!,0,Outerwear
"After reading the reviews  i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.   i'm 5'4""  126 pounds and generally wear a size small  but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much  and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.",0,Dresses

I love the design  that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online  but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please!,0,Dresses
I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde,0,Swim

Lightweight  airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker  higher quality silk. the waist has a tight  wide  elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.,0,Skirts

Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit,0,Dresses

This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it,0,Blouses

This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.,0,Skirts

I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out,0,Dresses

On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.,0,Dresses
This wears nicely  and is true to photo. flattering in the waist  and on a petite  everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially  there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone.,0,Dresses
After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black,0,Dresses
I love the unusual print  but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back  and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!,0,Dresses

I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.,0,Blouses

What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h,0,Dresses

Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer,0,Blouses

I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.,0,Dresses

Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel,0,Dresses

Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits

I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.,0,Swim
After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!,0,Blouses

Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.,0,Knits

I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,0,Jeans

"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2""  112lbs...with a small frame.",0,Blouses

Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d  and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.,0,Blouses

I don't mind loose-fitting clothing  but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling  tying  pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes  and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body  i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings  then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed  especially since the design on the fabr,0,Jackets

"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",0,Dresses

I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders  however  i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling  but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it  but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun  loose look in a sweater.,0,Sweaters
I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh.  this top is just reall,0,Blouses

They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.,0,Jeans
I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!,0,Sweaters

I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.,0,Blouses

What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.,0,Sweaters

I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.,0,Blouses
I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!,0,Knits

I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice  light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification  however  it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist  larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips  but does very little to show off my waist. overall  it is just ok.,0,Dresses
The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall  this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.,0,Dresses
I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.,0,Legwear

Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.,0,Blouses

Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better,0,Jeans

I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.,0,Skirts

Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra  but after 3 kids  braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said  the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely  and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so  this one is going back.,0,Dresses
The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.,0,Dresses
This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.,0,Knits

The model makes this dress look amazing  but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful  i loved that  but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full  not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but  sadly  it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you  but few others.,0,Dresses

Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft  true fit  and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.',0,Knits

Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.,0,Outerwear

This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r,0,Blouses

If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.,0,Blouses

But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.,0,Knits

Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0,Knits

I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top  and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on  and once on  it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.,0,Blouses

This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit,0,Dresses

I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.,0,Dresses

This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined  the belt adds a needed accent  and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit  though  is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses  and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip  thigh,0,Dresses

First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.,0,Blouses

I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,0,Fine gauge

This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.,0,Knits
I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!,0,Knits

I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.,0,Jackets

I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters
I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is,0,Dresses

I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very  very rarely a size 0  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose  flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however  the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.    i do really like the styling and quality  so i am planning on,0,Blouses

I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses

I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top,0,Dresses
I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well  in my usual 4 petite  i think it would look nice on some people  as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.,0,Dresses

But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.,0,Dresses

I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately  the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area  but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture  i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank,0,Knits
I adore this blouse  but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.,0,Blouses
The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.,0,Knits

This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.,0,Knits

I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange  without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful  however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath  but it is so sheer you need something.,0,Dresses

The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,0,Swim

I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,0,Dresses

Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.,0,Knits
This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.     the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.,0,Dresses

First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin,0,Blouses
I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.,0,Dresses

While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.,0,Lounge
"This top is gorgeous in person  but when i tried it on  i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately  but the more i wore it around the fitting room area  the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8""  140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes  it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.",0,Knits

I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.,0,Dresses

In my opinion  for this amount of money  the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material  dark color  flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)  initially  the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front  but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.  there's too much going on up top. th,0,Dresses

I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.,0,Jeans
Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs  and 4 was the smallest size available  so i ordered it. when i opened it  it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.,0,Dresses

Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea,0,Fine gauge
This is a really cute shirt. i love the design  color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs  i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.,0,Knits

I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos  size 0 in most pants   25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.,0,Jeans
Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.,0,Dresses
I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it  it looked exactly as it does in the picture online  however  the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms  which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt  but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.,0,Knits
So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.,0,Pants

I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.,0,Knits

I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even,0,Swim
I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape,0,Fine gauge

This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.,0,Dresses

I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot,0,Dresses

"I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2""  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.",0,Knits
Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms.

The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,0,Swim
Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.,0,Fine gauge

Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

When i received this tank  i ordered the blue  i almost returned it because it seemed really thin  almost see through. however  once i tried it on it had a good fit  not see through  just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort  especially because it is on the thin side.,0,Knits
This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews  i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however  this top hangs like a tent. also  the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar,0,Blouses
I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft  comfortable fabric  as other reviewers have mentioned  and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace  nothing sharp  pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.,0,Knits

I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,0,Jackets

I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.,0,Dresses

I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0,Dresses

This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,0,Fine gauge
Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress  fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.,0,Dresses

This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,0,Skirts

I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.,0,Dresses

Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,0,Jackets

Beautiful fabric  but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed  but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look.     also  the arms and the top portion are a tad small  so if you have a larger bust/arms  this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall  but was no way for me to make it work.,0,Dresses
These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way,0,Lounge

"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",0,Jackets

I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses

This item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up  and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining,0,Pants

I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,0,Dresses
L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place  but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.,0,Swim
I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a,0,Trend

I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,0,Blouses
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,0,Dresses
I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.,0,Blouses

Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures  and it has a lovely quality in person  the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on  and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips  large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.,0,Dresses
Overall  it's a beautiful dress  and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price)  and as other reviewers have mentioned  it's just a tad too short. for reference  i'm 5'5  125 lbs and the 2 fit well  but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.,0,Dresses

First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,0,Blouses

I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the,0,Dresses

This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick  it is soft  and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my,1,Skirts
"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo.

Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned  it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra  i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry  but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow,1,Dresses

I love pilcro legging jeans (and cords!) and this pair was no exception. i didn't see much difference in the fit  and i bought my usual 27. the stretch definitely creates a lot of give  but i don't mind. i'd be hesitant to size down in the waistband  but if you usually have room and prefer a more snug fit then go ahead. washed well the first time.,1,Jeans
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,1,Dresses

This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,1,Dresses

The pattern  while beautiful  is on a much more yellow-ivory background than pictured. the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose  like it would not support the skirt. while i did like it  i didn't love it  so it had to go back.,1,Skirts
I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me.,1,Dresses
This dress is really beautiful  but the fullness of the skirt made it a bit too precious for me. i liked that the neckline isn't too low  i could wear a bra with straps with it  the knee-length hem is perfect and the back is beautiful. but the skirt is really princessy. might work for a bridesmaid or an evening occasion but i found it too shiny and girly for less formal events.,1,Dresses
This dress looks simple  but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool  saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.,1,Dresses

Definitely a curve hugger. i bought the summer version of this dress (sleeveless white with black stripes) earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long. was very excited to see a fall/winter version to pair with tights and boots. bought a medium again and it fits great. this is a very flattering dress  and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws.,1,Dresses

Beautiful summery dress with bright fun print. i think this was well worth the sale price i paid. it lays nicely and is flattering. i went down a size from my normal 8 to a 6. however as other reviewers have said  the arm holes/halter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore  you can see bra on the sides. i'm going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect. can't wait to wear this on my vacation!,1,Dresses
I love this tee! i got the navy color and the quality is good. it's a light and soft linen that is opaque. (i can't vouch for the other color though). it's a very loose fit but it's not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge. i'm very short and the xsp comes to my hip. i'm almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too... the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide  it might show,1,Knits

It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.,1,Blouses
I read the reviews before i bought this sweater online. one person did mention that the side slits were cut very high  but i had no idea! when i tried the xs on at home i was quite surprised by just how high up those side slits were. with just a pair of jeans  you could see flesh! at first i thought it maybe wouldn't work  but i decided to keep it because everything else about the sweater is lovely. i'll be layering this with a tank underneath. it's a bit quirky and funky and that appeals to me!,1,Fine gauge
I can't wear this without getting dozens of compliments. plus  it's comfortable! it's very soft. it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots  with pants  or with skirts. i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. everyone wants to know where i got it! it's very well made and the embroidery is well done. it doesn't look like it is going to come undone anytime soon.,1,Knits
I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape  but when i put on the green one  i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much  i purchased the blue as well. love  love  love!,1,Dresses

I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable  stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.,1,Knits

I love almost everything about this. first  you know  it's cashmere -- soft soft soft without being heavy. i'm a little afraid to wear it it's so nice. i got the gray  which is a beautiful  light  casual shade of gray that looks great with everything. the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless (they hang lower than i can reach with my hands).  the construction is a bit odd at first. it took me some brow-furrowing to figure out how to put it on  and i don't love the way the two front panels hang,1,Fine gauge

I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but  in person  it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.,1,Knits

First  i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short  because  well  it is. that being said  it is a perfect length for someone who is petite  like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets  which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size  is wonderfully warm and cozy  and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :),1,Jackets

I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug  not too tight  and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in  ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle  based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different  may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces  why it flutters so nicely.,1,Blouses

This dress is quite adorable - the pattern  slip and bottom lace trim are very nice. i found that this ran large  particularly in the bust. i am a 34c and felt that the xs was still a bit too big. i decided to pass due to the fit and the price  but i will re-visit if it makes it to the sale room. also note that the front buttons are purely decorative  and can't be buttoned to tighten the top up.,1,Dresses

Wow. bailey 44 knocks it out of the park with this sensual  i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut,1,Dresses

As most other reviewers stated  the skirt does run a bit large and long. however  it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!,1,Skirts

Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.    only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist  but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop  as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist.,1,Dresses
I have many left of center tees  and this one is a part of that same family. i got the deep purple (kind of an eggplant color)  which is perfect for fall. the sleeves are long  the cotton is thick  and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem. it's not quite 5 stars for me  though  because it is very high on the sides--not too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms. not a deal breaker for me  though.,1,Knits

I tried this dress on in the store and it fit pretty much perfectly in all the right areas except that the top of the zipper puckered away from my body and didn't lay flat. it just kept poking my arm. i tried it in a smaller size to see if that was the issue  but i encountered the same issue. too bad  as it was otherwise lovely and felt very comfortable.    i tried the green color. i think in person  it's slightly more rich green  less blue/aqua than the photos online.,1,Dresses

I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;),1,Dresses
I ordered this online with out trying it on the store. it does hang a teeny bit loser than in the photo of the model but in my opinion doesn't look bad. plus  i'm not a model...;) what i did was put a thick belt on and it just brought the dress to a new level. love it with a belt. i am an art teacher and it was perfect for work and then going out after with friends.

I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work  cocktails  and once  two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters,1,Dresses
"I love how unique this vest is. i'm still figuring out how to wear it in a feminine way  as it lacks shape at the waist and the collar sometimes doesn't behave. i think the sweater texture makes it more casual  but i could belt it and wear with fancier shoes to glam it up. it is a nice third piece to keep warm for fall or winter--hopefully i""ll wear it more once i figure it out!",1,Sweaters

These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy  and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic  which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist  so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that  their silky material give them the ill,1,Pants
Snagged this dress in store today. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is dry clean only although i will probably attempt to home wash. it runs very large. i am usually a medium but currently nursing a baby so need large to fit the chest but i bought this dress in a small. also  it can be elegantly worn backward so the zipper is in front to provide nirsing access. i don't think anyone but you would know you are wearing it backwards. very heavy fabric which makes it drape nicel,1,Dresses

This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also  the colors in t,1,Blouses
The shape is flattering on my postpartum body. even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest  the swing shape hides my stomach area. the material doesn't seem particularly breathable  so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot  humid weather; but for my summers in the pacific northwest  it'll be fine.,1,Knits

I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,1,Dresses

I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price  and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however  the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think,1,Blouses
Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also  100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny  you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.,1,Sleep
I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress,1,Dresses
The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building  but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist  the loose fit at the hips  and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would,1,Dresses

This blouse is basically a rectangular piece of fabric that is folded over and sewn up the sides. the side seams are about 2-3 inches in from the edge of the fabric. the neck opening is finished nicely. the fabric has a nice drape to it  but the design on the front isn't as crisp and clear as i thought it would be; the design is a bit fuzzy. so i wish the picture on the front were clearer. i always wear an xl in retailer tops  but the size l in this fit nicely in the bust except is too snug at the,1,Blouses

This was a bit of a disappointment. the colors are beautiful  but the shape was not flattering on my petite frame. it is somewhat wide and boxy in the shoulders and body. the fabric is stiffer that i expected  and therefore it doesn't drape nicely on the shoulders and through the torso. if you look closely at the model  you can see what i am talking about at the shoulder. the shoulders stick out a tad  and the gathering at the neck contributes to the larger  boxy look. this might look nice on th,1,Blouses

Love this top! i'm 5'7  145 pounds  athletic build  and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut  so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment  but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back  as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality  and i would order this in more colors if it were available!,1,Layering

This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd  and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person  as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback  which depends on your taste  is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow,1,Dresses

The color is a very dark mustard yellow  thin/light-weight material  and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m  i recommend the size up for hip fit.,1,Blouses
The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it  cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress  it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back  i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!    wearing this to south beach  it will be perfect with strappy  high heels.,1,Lounge

This dress is easy to wear  lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason  the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although  to be fair  i am small-chested).,1,Dresses
I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,1,Blouses

As stated by others  this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long  although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations  retailer  for a winner!,1,Sweaters

This top is beautiful. the cutout portion extends below the bust  but is intricate enough to look good with a black bra or exciting with  say  a taupe or grey one. the fit across the shoulders is snug  but the rest of the top is very voluminous. don't expect to tuck this swamp thing in. it's a bit of an odd contrast  but if you're prepared to wear something that is itself a beautiful object  even if it doesn't really make sense for a human body... this is it.,1,Knits

This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of. it fits very true to size and is the perfect length  about to ankles. the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it... gorgeous! once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots  and an undershirt. i plan on rocking this all fall and winter!,1,Dresses

I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently  but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.,1,Blouses
I love the weight of the material; sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap; this does not. the lace trim is more 2-tone than the photo suggests  but that is not negative  and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach  again  not a negative. the length is as it is on the model  just below the knee. i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach! i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops. i felt special  stylish and comfortable. it was a good dress for some,1,Dresses

I bought this in the sky color (and sized down from my normal medium) and absolutely love it. i don't think it's boxy at all. on the contrary  i love the way it hangs (i don't find it to be short either  though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath). p.s. the ruffle detail is precious!,1,Knits

I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts: _________________ pros: - the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart. - pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :) - the length is ideal for taller folk. - it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am  this won't be an issue. - nicely conservative at the top.  cons: - i,1,Dresses

I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,1,Skirts

This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry  jacket  even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.,1,Dresses

I love the look of peplum tops  i think they are very forgiving  and they do a fantastic job of hiding my residual baby weight while still allowing me to look like i have an amazing figure (not washed out figure). i have several peplum tops  but most of them are made out of a thicker fabric and they don't have much movability. i absolutely love this one because it is a more casual design and much more comfortable than i am used to while still keeping the integrity of the peplum design. the fabri,1,Knits

"I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10"" and 145 pounds  and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures  at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh  as shown  and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though  i decided to return the dress  because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati",1,Dresses
Love the color  weight and styling on this sweater. it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot. the only downfall is that it sheds  so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere.,1,Sweaters
One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned  the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before  so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger  but i definitely have neede,1,Dresses
This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric  has some stretch  big pockets with cute lining  buttons are adorable  perfect knee length  sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big  the pocket line is visible on my thigh area  so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves  your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character  but it!!,1,Skirts

I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6)  and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc,1,Skirts
I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon  not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right  not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special  this is the top for you!,1,Blouses
These pants are super flattering. they can be worn to work or on the weekend dressed up or down. they are slimming and fit very nicely. my only complaint is that they start to look worn  the black fades  as you wash them over time. please don't stop carrying them!!,1,Pants
I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd  but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt  but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels  it would be a keeper for me.,1,Knits
I really want to love this shirt  but the small is just way too big on me. for reference  i'm a 32d (which is why i didn't want to size down much more than a small)  5'6' and 125 and i'm drowning in this. i'm going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!!,1,Blouses

Beautiful color and flattering design! cons: tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing. i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron. i didn't even have a chance to wear it  but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price.,1,Knits

I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great  but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.,1,Dresses

My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on  and how they fit  and she brought this dress in  with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug  highlight every bump  and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.,1,Dresses

I just received this in the green color. it is a true medium jade green. my monitor shows a blue color and that is what i expected. the green is pretty but i would have preferred the blue that was shown. i found this to fit large . the pockets that are barely visible in any of the photos gape open and don't lie flat. i do like this sweater as a very casual jacket alternative on cooler days. the cashmere is a nice weight and is not too precious to wear every day with jeans.,1,Fine gauge
Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.,1,Dresses

I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6  130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm  and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.,1,Fine gauge

I love these jeans-the minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable. they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic. i ordered my normal size-i usually wear a 27 and could have kept them-but wanted a snugger fit through the bum. so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me.,1,Jeans

Love this quirky romper. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12 and took a large in this. as the other reviews stated  it's a bit of a contortion act to get into and out of this but when in it fits well  is flattering and oh so cute.,1,Dresses
I got this skirt in the dove grey  which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3  102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured  i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas,1,Skirts

"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket  but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but  i live in california  so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it",1,Trend
I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,1,Knits
This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i'd normally take a small  got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer.,1,Jackets

I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material)  which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!,1,Knits

Really cute skirt  but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy  so if you got them  forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt.,1,Skirts

This is a lovely  romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said  the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size 4 and 6 for me to try. when i got there  i finally settled on a size 2  so it runs a bit large. i have a 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style  give it a try  you won't be disappointed.,1,Skirts

Yay  i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff  as well as summer festivals  nights out  travel  etc. i love the design  length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice  but in a very casual  appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages  it's flattering for us curvier ladies ,1,Dresses
I was a little surprised when i received this dress  as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined  and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through  for it is black  but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this  but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t,1,Dresses
I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!,1,Dresses
"I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel ""sack-like"". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous.",1,Dresses
I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said  the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress  although if you are a taller person  the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.,1,Knits
Bought this somewhat on a whim during a promo in yellow  which is a lovely light cheery yellow (didn't make my pale skin look terrible). i love the detail of the dress and the swing silhouette. the slip is also of good quality. i don't love where the slip falls in the lace panel near the bust because it looks a little funny to me in a distracting way  but i'm keeping the dress. it's cute and fun :),1,Dresses
Such a gorgeous top  the detail and fit are amazing. however  after wearing the top for about 8 hours  7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but  i love the top so much  i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.,1,Blouses
I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red  but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit  flirty  flattering  very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned  the fabric is a bit heavy for summer  but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment  no biggie  i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering  chest area not too snug  and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs  26.5 in,1,Dresses

Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch  so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look  and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top  and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me  but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g,1,Dresses

For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight  it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length  super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet  but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.,1,Knits

I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping  the weight of the fabric  and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline  but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open.,1,Knits
I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well  no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.,1,Pants

It's amazing!    i did size down on this one  but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area  but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem  but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my,1,Knits

This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms  it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price  and the amount of time i wanted to wear it  it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue  this is the dress for you. however  if you are hot,1,Dresses

This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair  they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so  that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.,1,Blouses
I love the quality of this little gem. it's going to be used as an under a sweater top and also to fill a v-neck line dress up that's too low for me. it's made very well in my opinion but it runs a bit too full so if you are between sizes you could easily go down a size.,1,Knits

Dress is cute and comfortable to wear. i bought the black motif in regular size 0. it fits perfectly and falls just above my knees. i have washed it in the washing machine placed in a large zippered mesh bag and hung it to dry. as mentioned in previous reviews  with the exception of it being unlined  it's a wonderful dress and am so happy to have it.,1,Dresses
This dress is gorgeous. the fabric is thick and layered with well designed lines. since the fabric is thick  it gives very little around your body. i have wide hips  a big butt and bust so this dress unfortunately was not a good fit for me. i usually fit in a 6 petite and for this one i got an 8. it fit around my bust and hips  but was bunched up in the back. i would definitely at least give this dress a try because it was very beautiful.,1,Dresses
T.la makes the best tees. soft feel  sophisticated color layering  and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile  too. other tees fade  stretch out  shrink. not t.la. a gem.,1,Knits
So this is actually a holding horses dress  its mislabeled on the website. tts  a stunning vintage inspired piece  very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut  this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small  fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!,1,Dresses
"It's a lovely and unexpected sweater. a few things to keep in mind-     - the knit details are beautiful- the pictures don't do it justice.    - it's pretty lightweight.    - the color is a little darker than the picture shown- it's a very dark plum    - it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long.     - the style is decidedly casual and ""slouchy"". it looks great with jeans  but don't plan to dress up an outfit with this piece.",1,Knits
I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made  super soft  and works well with jeans  capris  skirts  and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though  this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a,1,Knits

I didn't like the price tag  but got a good price with a sale  so i splurged! this skirt hugs curves in the nicest  most flattering way without feeling like you have to hold in your belly:) very cute ruched design and soft make it easily dressed up or down. i plan to wear with some bright flats for an upcoming trip  but have the perfect white tennies for casual everyday. love it!!,1,Skirts
"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2""  120lbs  tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs  and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy  and it drapes well. because i am petite  the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately  the petite xs is sold out  so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti",1,Skirts
"When i saw this skirt on line  i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle  with a little sheen  ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions  from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7"")  with a flattering and comfortable cut.",1,Skirts

I find that this brand can be a little bit all-over-the-place with sizes. had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m. despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well. i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this. just something to keep in mind. still a great shirt  love the neutral color.,1,Knits
I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better),1,Dresses
I am petite  5'2  and i ordered the xxsp  i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large  it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.,1,Blouses

I just received this top today  and as usual  retailer doesn't disappoint!! it's beautiful  runs a bit generous and has such pretty detail. i'm 5'2  128 pounds and always wear a size small. this small fits well with just enough room to be a little generous around your waist. what a steal!! don't miss this perfect addition to any wardrobe.,1,Knits
I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket  so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium  and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.,1,Knits
This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater  (which is fabulous ) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures  the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say  i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!,1,Jackets
This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern  and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.,1,Knits
Versatile piece to finish out your look. love how it goes with so much of my wardrobe. simple  comfortable  and classic.,1,Jackets
This is such a great addition to my fall wardrobe. this is so cute! i'm 5'9 and this fits perfectly. i don't usually do well with some of the cropped pieces but this one has such a complementary cute. the sleeves are just the right length. i've had lots and lots of complements on this one! it's a keeper!,1,Sweaters

I absolutely love the color  cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress,1,Dresses
I loved this dress on. the material was quite different than expected  almost a canvas-y feel to it. ran a little large  but so cute.,1,Dresses
I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing  lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage  and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it  but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.,1,Knits

Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.,1,Pants

This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy  flattering  cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said  ti is a 3 - even 4 - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy.,1,Dresses
I really love this tee! but  the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.,1,Knits
Cute skirt and print  but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture  but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.,1,Skirts
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,1,Pants

Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small  extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders  32dd  so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a,1,Knits
I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them  but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale.,1,Jeans
Purchased this dress in black and love it. there is so much detail in the crochet  and can be dressed up or down. i am contemplating buying the same dress in white!,1,Dresses
I love this tee  i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.,1,Knits
The picture is accurate. i got the plum version. the color and effect are really unique. the fit is tts. i wear an 8 in tops and the medium is fine. the sleeves are flattering-  belled but not ridiculous. the fabric is soft. if the body of the top was a little less wide it would be a 5 star item. with flare legs  i think it will balance out the volume of the cut.,1,Knits
This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8  maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn't get into the 8  the 10 was uncomfortably tight  and even the 12 was snug (i haven't worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman's body. since i already have curves  i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again  lovely blouse  but i would no,1,Blouses

Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.,1,Blouses
This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does!

Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet  but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined  and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i,1,Jackets

Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.,1,Dresses
I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly  they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.,1,Lounge
Ordered online  hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft  comfortable  nice drape.

It was a little on the thinner side (fabric)  a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back  i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable  and the back is beautiful (love bows)  tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price  even on sale  i didn't feel i absolutely needed it  but if you are looking for a hite tank  it is pretty cute.

This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem,1,Sweaters
Like another reviewer  i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large  and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric  and his is he perfect length for leggings.,1,Knits
I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!,1,Blouses
It's a pretty dress  my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or  if you are a savvy sewer  you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6  but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.,1,Dresses

I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr,1,Dresses

This dress fits so well  it is extremely well cut and flattering. the length is perfect (i am 5'5).  i passed on it though  because i didn't love the color. almost like a navy blue that has been washed one too many times. if this dress had more color options or made in a cute print i would not hesitate to buy it. if blue is your color go for it.,1,Dresses
I really wanted the dark grey  but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person  the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size  and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.,1,Jeans
I tell everyone i know to try these jeans  that they are so worth the price tag. i've been an ag super fan for years  but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on.

The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,1,Dresses

This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim  & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms  and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light  but i love in so cal  so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies  heeled clogs  and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4  140lb  34b  and the 8 fits perfectly.,1,Dresses
I first saw this top earlier in the year. i watched for it to go on sale and it finally did over the labor day holiday + 40% off. i was very happy about that. it runs a tiny bit big. i got the s. i wonder if the xs would have been better but i kept the small because of the price and how cute it looked on. it looks gray online but it is more greenish gray. it has a cute back detail  too. it looks cute with jeans and gray pants. it is just cute and different than most of my other tops.,1,Knits
I have still not decided if i am keeping this dress. i sized up according to the other reviews. i typically wear a 6  so i got an 8. it fit me just fine on top  but i am a 36b  so fairly small. because of the photos  i expected the dress to be a-line and flare out at the hips. it did not  that that's why i am unsure. i'd like it to flare out a little more than it does. it would be more flattering and more comfortable. i love the dress otherwise. i think i may take it to a tailor and see if there,1,Dresses

Lightweight and comfy fabric  very flattering on  except runs a bit big through the body. i normally wear a 12/14 and a l at most stores  but retailer seems to run large on me  so i needed to exchange this for a smaller size as the fabric width on the body was just too much.,1,Knits
This is an amazing dress! it did stretch out a little  so although i got the large  i probably could've gotten the medium. beautiful feel  fully lined  on the really hot days  this is what i grab and i stay cool all day. i get so many compliments on this dress! the colors are gorgeous!,1,Dresses

This top is amazing. it's a little stretchy but doesn't cling and it's surprisingly flattering on my curvy figure. i have a large chest and the shirt fits perfectly with or without a cami underneath. the material is very soft and the print is vibrant and fun. the shirt does run a little large. the only slight issue i have is that it is a little shorter than i usually like on my long torso. other than that  it's pretty much perfect.,1,Knits
"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else.",1,Intimates
"I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9"" tall)  32d chest. i liked it  it was comfortable  but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end  i d",1,Lounge
First of all  the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad  but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.    at any rate  i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers  i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t,1,Skirts

I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.,1,Sweaters

This looks exactly as shown in the photo. you can tell that it's a really thin  lightweight knit that's almost transparent.  i ordered a large and it fits the way it does on the model. am returning because i have a large 34 g bust and this top really emphasized my chest. it also grabs a bit under the arms. the color looks just like it does in the photos. it hangs nicely and isn't oversized  which i liked. the texture and ribbing on the sleeves  hem and pocket take this a step up from the ordinar,1,Fine gauge

I hesitated initially buying this because of the unique fit in the neckline and shoulders and because i have broad shoulders. but if you adjust the neck  sleeves and play with the overall fit of the shirt  it works. the boxy airy design has to be paired with something that flows with it (i.e. linen pants) or trusty denim. otherwise you may have a battle on your hands finding a complementary pairing!,1,Blouses

I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun  nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!,1,Blouses

I bought the black motif  the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful  but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos  but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!,1,Blouses

I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.,1,Dresses

I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit  but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing  but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha,1,Trend
A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but  it does snag very easily. so far  i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black  which concentrates the black when snagged.,1,Knits
This top is true to size  although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin  i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v  but haven't tried it yet  let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...,1,Knits

I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm  but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly  which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.,1,Sweaters
I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right  not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits,1,Dresses

This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy  with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover  and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)  the first time i wore this top  i paired it with denim shorts  and the hemline completely covered the shorts  so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover  i'd just go with yoga shorts benea,1,Knits
This lightweight sweater arrived within a few days of ordering and was packaged well. its fit is true to size and will be perfect for slightly cool days and evenings. the navy blue color is accurately represented in the picture. my only issue with this item is that one of the small lace panels at the hem on the hip is not sewn in all the way. i will keep it since it was on sale  but i need to decide whether to have it fixed or to just remove both of them as they are very small and don't add much,1,Knits
I love the colors and pattern on this dress  and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however  i'm pretty small up top  and the neckline comes pretty low  so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra  or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet  but will keep the dress for sure.,1,Dresses
Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic  comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.,1,Blouses

I love the ruching on this hoodie  which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small  34b  130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).,1,Lounge
In true cloth & stone fashion  this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small  but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash)  and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down  depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.,1,Dresses

Love the tee in the red. it's not too sheer and the metal detail on the shoulders turns it from a simple tee to a tee with a little more pizazz. fits true to size. i take either a medium or large in retailer and this in a size large fits well. it is a bit boxy  but not sloppy. on sale it's a great deal.,1,Knits

Never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it.  i've never seen flannel patterns and colors like this. the details in the back are unique. but in the end  i decided to return because it's too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didn't look that great on me. the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame. the fabric smells odd. i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk.,1,Trend

This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large  however  so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible.,1,Knits

It's a soft comfy fabric... cute ruffle... may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute! very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person!,1,Knits
"Love this sweater! beautiful detail  thicker yarn and well made. sweater has more structure to it than i had anticipated  which makes it look more tailered while being soft and comfortable. hits my lower hip and i'm 5'6"". receive compliments every time i wear it.",1,Fine gauge
The lines on the dress are lovely. the material is a nice thick jersey  which can be body-hugging  but mostly on top. it falls beautifully and looks good with heels and flats and boots. i am xs or s depending on the dress  and i got the xs in this one.,1,Dresses
"This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot.",1,Blouses
I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.,1,Knits
These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out  wash in cold  and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets  but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i,1,Jeans

Soft  silky  lined in silky natural fabric  hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite  but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes  so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!,1,Dresses
I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory  not pure white  which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w,1,Dresses
Very well made and would flatter the right body type. i sized up to a medium (normally size 6)  but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me. the only thing you could see was the grey liner. i'm not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly  or it ran terribly small. i have had success with bailey 44 in the past so maybe this one was just not for me. the quality of the fabric and design are well done.,1,Dresses
"Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color   but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall  but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and",1,Skirts
Great dramatic cardigan  wearable art  and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots  jeans and boots  or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you  attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.,1,Fine gauge
Absolutely love these. i ordered them in bronze and i'm thinking about getting the lilac pair as well. they're super comfortable and look great on.,1,Jeans
I really like this jacket! it runs big  so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting  but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!,1,Jackets
Love  love love this top. it's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top. i tend to wear a small in retailer  but the medium was the way to go for me. it's not long  and the style errs on the not-tight side. if you can go between two sizes  don't get the smaller one. and i love the shade of yellow!,1,Knits
Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy  and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring  summer; heck  all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!,1,Dresses
Comfortable and a great color for spring and summer,1,Pants
Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again  a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.,1,Outerwear
I really like the style of this top  the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small  but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.,1,Knits
"These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2"" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties  which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24"". i don't know if that's true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that's around a 26"" inseam  but definitely a great length and i don't need to hem. the leg opening isn't too big  so i can roll it up/cuff them to get",1,Jeans
I'm a slightly pear shaped girl. a c chest with size 14 hips. the dress fit great around my waist and would have been perfect except the space in the chest area was too big. it looked odd on me with all the extra fluff in the chest. fabric is nice and flowy. the dress is lined.,1,Dresses

The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely  and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer  but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes  i would probably size up.,1,Blouses
This is great without a belt  with or without leggings. it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted  big behind women (like me).,1,Dresses
This is such a soft  comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!,1,Knits

I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.,1,Blouses
It's lightweight  which is perfect for summer officewear when i don't want bare arms. my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer. this shirt is sheer but not as much as most  in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheer-ness. i don't find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly  i've worn it to work with a nude bra  and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour. i went a size up to a small becaus,1,Blouses
Okay  these are seriously the cutest black jeans i've ever put on my body. i can't say enough positive things about them. sure  the color bleeds a little (like the previous review stated)  but they're black jeans. i haven't encountered a single pair of designer black jeans that don't have some color transfer.     also  these jeans are really stretchy which makes them a dream to wear.     here is my one complaint -- i am normally a size 29-30 depending upon brand  cut etc. i had to size down to a,1,Jeans

Beautiful dress. when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad. but it is absolutely beautiful. would highly recommend it - can dress it up or down.,1,Trend

This top is very cute! however  it runs quite large. i ordered my usual size - xs but it looked rather heavy on me. the construction of the top was boxy and didn't produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture. it's a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit.,1,Knits
This definitely works for you - think fabric  great quality  and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant  cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.,1,Blouses
Super cute and comfy. bottom of the legs have about a 8in slit that is not shown in pictures. also the hem came unraveled after the first wear. worth the money on sale! received many compliments. not see through!,1,Pants
I liked this bc it is long  ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.,1,Fine gauge
I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .,1,Shorts

Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs  curvy.,1,Jackets
I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however  when i tried it on  i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck  arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy  although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me  but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so  it may be best to wear a cami,1,Dresses
I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit  so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.,1,Jeans
This was about to be my first retailer splurge item  but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag  these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.,1,Pants

I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down  but i bought it online  so i just decided to live with it. pretty top  though i do think it runs large.,1,Blouses
"As others have mentioned  they're quite long. i'm 5'8"" and need to wear 2"" heels to make sure these don't drag. they're much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles.",1,Jeans
The fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe  which isn't clear from the photo. much nicer in person than online. runs large. i wear a large in knit tops (36d and to hide a soft belly) but this large was too big. armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy. i'll exchange for a m because i think i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. a casual tank with a little spunk. cute!,1,Knits

"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso  almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition  they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame  they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.",1,Pants

Pilcro runs one size smaller this year - i compared with pants that i ordered last year and sure enough  one inch difference in waist. i did not notice difference in other dimensions of this garment  so my best guess is that pilcro decided to make tighter waist due to some complaints last year about waist being ?too lose?. i personally prefer sporty silhouette and am not thrilled with this change  but pants fit and are nice color and quality  so they stay. however  i am not sure i would order th,1,Pants

I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen  i usually don't like linen much  it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.,1,Knits
This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops  and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though  which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp  it actually looks bigger. regardless  i love it and was o,1,Jackets

This is a well-made kimono style jacket  in a great color choice that is versatile and well constructed. being short and with narrow shoulders  most kimono-style jackets don't work on me; they are simply too big & too long. this jacket's shorter length and more streamlined styling make it perfect for me. a keeper  and a real steal on sale.,1,Jackets

This coat is very nice. it's soft and the colors are great. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars and not 5 is that it runs huge! i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium. when i put it on i just started laughing. it was so huge. i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size. i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did,1,Outerwear
I love this tunic  super flattering + long enough (if your no super tall like me) to wear with leggings! it does run a little big  i like tops a little looser on me so i didn't mind that. i ordered a small- if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down.     i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!    thanks retailer for being awesome!,1,Blouses

Love this shirt. the print is a little loud  but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however  that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty  if that helps. the red is short-sleeved  by the way if ordered online  cute and flattering.,1,Knits
This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer  or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight  it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage  but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses,1,Blouses

I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid  a bit steep at full price.     i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made.     the material is a lightwei,1,Outerwear

The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times  with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large  and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer  if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v,1,Blouses

This dress is adorable. i got it in red and it is very flattering. i love the shape - it has a slight flare without being too full. the fabric is firm so it holds a nice shape  and there is a stretchy material lining on the inside that make it very comfortable. my only complaint  and why i didn't give it a 5 star rating  is that the zipper sticks at the ribbon junctions. a bit frustrating  but not enough that i won't keep the dress.,1,Dresses
This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim  but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior  the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.,1,Jackets
Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model  it's a form-fitting style. it's not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i'm not wow-ed by it  but it's nice in a 50's kind of way.,1,Fine gauge
This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy  go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats  booties  sandals  etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.,1,Dresses

This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking  that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck ,1,Sweaters

I ordered this in size xl. the fit is true to size. it fits me as it does on the model. the draping is very flattering. i'm a pear-shape and this shape works well. it definitely needs a tank underneath. you could sew a bit of the top to keep it closed. otherwise  everything can show. i like using different colored tanks to pull out the colors in the pattern.  the quality of the material is outstanding. the print looks so much prettier in person. it's very vibrant. the photos online  at least on,1,Knits
I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color  it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.â â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.â â i am 5?2?  116 lbs and a 32d.â â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee.,1,Dresses
This is not your traditional moth sweater  in that  it is not soft and cozy. this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat! i haven't been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like. it's pretty true to size  so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason. they paired it with a cloth + stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too!,1,Sweaters

Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected  but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up  it might be a little longer in the body  but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick  so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!,1,Knits

Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.,1,Dresses
This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist  - or if you have broad shoulders  the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p  with a 00p hip measurement  a middle range (00p is 24  0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement  but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p  the larger,1,Dresses

It's not often you can find a dress that is warm  cozy  timeless  and sexy at the same time  but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s  and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be  depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place  so i'm not always adjusting it.  i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots,1,Dresses

"Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust  blue  goldenrod  green throughout. super soft  stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust  long torso  broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.",1,Sweaters

I actually rather like this top  i ordered a size smaller than usual  based on how flowy it looks in the picture  and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich  and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it  and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot  but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material  so of course  it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also  there was no petite in the pink  so can't comment on,1,Blouses

Based on reviewers' comments  i sized up and ordered an 8 (normally i run 4-6). and while the waist fit pretty well  the bust was too large and roomy (i'm a34b bust). i eventually got ahold of a 6 and the waist still fits and the bust is much better. so for me  at least the two dresses i got are true to fit. and the dress is very pretty and i'm excited to wear it!!!....i guess since it's fall i may have to wait until next year...,1,Dresses

Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,1,Jeans
This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy  not black. very dark navy  yes. still  not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top  and i can wear it right now.,1,Knits

Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans  the script  and hyphen to name a few  absolutely love them  they fit tts  super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look  super soft  with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately  i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer  andddddd  they are no longer made in the usa  but in china....so you may need to try on,1,Jeans

This is a nice everyday jacket to wear with dresses  jeans  skirts  anything. i ordered the only color that had petite left  the plum. i liked it  but the fit was a little boxy  even as xs petite. length was nice  however. color was also a nice neutral  though it says plum  it is a darker brown. for reference  30dd chest  26.5 in waist  115 lbs - review on xsp.,1,Outerwear

I wanted to love this dress  and i don't. it is soft  it is flattering on the model  and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back  causing the drape along the bottom to look odd  and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband  but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again  very often.,1,Lounge

The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim  rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans  however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!,1,Jeans
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect!   i ordered a size 2 petite  which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.",1,Dresses

This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it  even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous  you don't see coats like this on the street  not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft  yet warm  and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed. it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 (,1,Outerwear

I bought this is in the gray color  although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said  and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it  giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.,1,Sweaters

I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured  i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.  i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer.   this jacket runs smaller  the sleeves were very tight   and overall it was just too small. had to return it.,1,Jackets
I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did  but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter  it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather  but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn,1,Sweaters

I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers  i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress  which is not easily noticable in the web photos  and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.,1,Dresses

I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great true to size i am xsmall-small for reference  purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater  or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!,1,Blouses

The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,1,Layering

I just received the top today  and will send back for a larger size. i am i between a 4 and 6  so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy. it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders. i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger. the shirt also had a slight musty odor. it's a rather thin chambray....with 3/4 sleeves. the top came to just the top of my jeans  which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering.,1,Blouses
"Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however  the proportions are off. based on other reviews  i ordered a petite (i am 5'4"" and don't normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck won't be almost to my belly button.",1,Dresses

This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large  and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy  but because it's more sheer  it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall  and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight  but lose some of the volume.,1,Blouses
I'm pretty petite and have small boobs so i should have gotten the xxs instead of the xs. however  since i'm currently pregnant (33 weeks) i figure i should buy the xs. it's a roomy dress and doesn't make you look like a boat if you're pregnant. which is awesome. since i don't have milk in my boobs yet  it's a tad roomy on the sides by my chest. not super noticeable though. i hate buying maternity clothes since they're pretty ugly and i don't like the fact that i wouldn't be able to wear it agai,1,Dresses
I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference  i'm 5'4  130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.,1,Blouses

I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium,1,Fine gauge
"I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3""  +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics  so that may vary a bit. however  the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash  but sometimes that's worth it.",1,Knits

First off  i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix  a white cami  the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.,1,Dresses
I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh,1,Layering

"Bought this on sale in my reg size- 10. im 5'9"" and about 36c. the fabric is heavy and pretty. this is a more formal top in my opinion. it is lined. it is much wider around the waist than appears on model. zips up the back  but i can pull on and off without unzipping.",1,Blouses

I bought the lavender one and i'm so glad i did. the sweater looks prettier in person and it's super soft! the back detailing makes this one not your average v-neck sweater. i highly recommend this to anyone!,1,Fine gauge
I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!,1,Dresses
This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full  but this one is just too voluminous. also  the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed  the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round  with sandals or boots.,1,Dresses
I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium  even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.,1,Knits

This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,1,Knits
I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106  5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!,1,Knits
I'm a little hesitant about the dropped-hem style but this drapes so well and looks utterly chic. i wore it to a poetry reading with some fluevogs and it not only looked good but it felt like i was wearing nothing. the material is beautifully soft and i love this particular shade of blue. will definitely be wearing this a lot.,1,Dresses

This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy  comfortable  stylish  and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down  the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red  but i think you could wear black boots with it  no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!,1,Dresses
"I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6  but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8""  small busted  and a ""pear"" shape  so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point.",1,Dresses

Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly  cotton  and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.,1,Knits

I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale  i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of  i really do recommend it- well made  lovely colors  and nice style.,1,Dresses
I really like this pullover. the design is beautiful  and i love the asymmetrical hem. my own complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy on me because i'm large-chested. it's more drapey than tailored. but it's not overwhelming and doesn't cancel out how much i like it overall.,1,Fine gauge

These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me  these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small  they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas,1,Lounge

Gorgeous pattern and colors for autumn. maeve does me good when it comes to maxi dresses. i have to say that the sizing is all over the place! i am generally a medium  but the small and xs (?!) fit me well also. the stretchiness of the jersey is very comfortable and forgiving  except at the ruched waistband  which took longer to stretch out  but it did eventually. i do need to hem if i want to wear flats  but the length works for my higher heels. there are pockets and a lining to my knees. i am,1,Dresses

Very happy with the fit of this sweater  which is flattering and unique. the ruffle elevates the piece. very soft and a good length for me (i got a medium) in both the sleeves and the body. the hole at the neck gaps a little  which may bug me as time goes on  but otherwise i am so pleased with this sweater that i am willing to put up with it. i ordered this in the red  which is more of an orangey red  which does not suit my skin tone. i will exchange for the blue/gray version.,1,Fine gauge

This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit  there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also  the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure.,1,Shorts
This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine  and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything  but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store  and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material  so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt  and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu,1,Skirts

As you can see from all the reviews  this dress is such a classic piece. my two cents below:  ____________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm either a 10 or 12 in most clothes and bought the l and it fit really well on my 5'9. 36c bust and hourglass frame. it wasn't boxy at all and still left enough for movement and still held a nice shape to my frame without being clingy.  - fabric is soft. it does seem a tad fuzzy  so just be careful what you wear. but the material overall is nice. i'm not sure how thick,1,Dresses

I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!,1,Lounge

This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line  so when you walk  it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens  but not all the way down  so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing.   but the sizing was a bi,1,Dresses

I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,1,Layering
I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites  i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.     i'm 5'6  160 lbs  and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length  waist and bust fit perfectly.,1,Pants

This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight. it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work. i am 5'3 (and a half!) and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels. this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels.,1,Dresses

Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,1,Lounge

I agree with the other reviewer  the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.,1,Jackets

I bought this item in store  in the loden green color. i absolutely love it as a light winter dress or tunic. the material is thin  but provides a nice coverage nonetheless. it is super duper comfy  and very figure flattering! i wear it mainly as a dress  and looks great with tights and ankle boots. so pleased ordering the other color.,1,Knits

"I love this top! although  i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home.",1,Blouses

Bought this and tried it on in the store. when i first tried it on  i thought it was off the shoulder but the elastic is so tight  it hurt within a minute of having it on. i got my usual size xs and it fits fine if i wear this as a regular top and not off the shoulder. it has a thin elastic  not the thicker band. maybe some could pull this off for off the shoulder but in my opinion  it's not comfortable that way. i bought the other white off the shoulder top from retailer last month and it's fine,1,Blouses

The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics  but in person i found it femine  pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky  colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy  gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.,1,Dresses
I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good  though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.     i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia,1,Sweaters

I ordered this top in the purple color and was pleasantly surprised that it was more of a soft periwinkle. the weave is quite open and sheer which is what i had hoped for. the fit is great and the bottom flows quite flatteringly. overall the sweater is soft and very feminine  but careful  it snags easily.,1,Fine gauge

This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice  i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer  which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra  which too many of this design do. it is a bit large  you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.,1,Lounge
I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy  comfortable  and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile  and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend  especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized  so i'd recommend erring,1,Knits

I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy  so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus  even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily  with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.,1,Dresses

Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small  but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people ,1,Blouses

"I love this dress  i love the style  i love the pattern  i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however  i think it runs a little large  particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature  and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds  5'5""  and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small  but i went with my usual size in dresses",1,Dresses

Love this. the stripes are cute and simple  but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank  so there is a lot of fabric  but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :),1,Knits

I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.,1,Dresses

I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available  so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white  like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress  but t,1,Dresses

This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).,1,Lounge
"Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4""  about 130 lbs  and the medium fits well. it is long in the back  but i like that. if the front were a little longer  i'd prefer that  but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing  very appropriate for this holiday season.",1,Blouses

I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p  i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice  you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs  30dd  26.5in waist  i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea.   material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!,1,Dresses
Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo .  2) you could wear this with almost any color top  black boots and youve got a great outfit!  3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.    cons  this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip  but seriously for this price it should be lined,1,Skirts

Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra  you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt  as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out  it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!,1,Dresses

Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it's for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric  but not intolerable. i love this dress but it's beyond a-line  it's a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that's seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy  thick shoulders/back/upper arms)  i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if,1,Dresses

I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.,1,Skirts

These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral  and wore with a black peasant top  sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though  so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model  and after a few hours they were hanging off of me  so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.,1,Pants

I normally wear an xl  but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely  but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person  and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl,1,Blouses
This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!  be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!,1,Dresses
This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however  it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust  balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price  but i'd probably snap it on sale.,1,Blouses

Being six feet tall  i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women  and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look  you can sometimes gain extra length  and it's true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues  and while it is billowy  it's not horribly so. i would think  however  if you're between sizes  or not worried about height  i'd go with the smaller option. adorable  comfy  casual while being dressy enough for a night out!,1,Blouses
This is such a darling velvet dress. understated  yet eye catching  i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder  but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.  i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and can't wait to wear it!,1,Dresses
Bought this is the blue  which is actually a very grey-blue.  i love cotton sweaters and they are not easy to find.  this one has lovely colors and unusual design  but is a bit too full.  that said  i am keeping it for the cotton/linen factor  alone.,1,Sweaters

I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me  but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built,1,Blouses

"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.",1,Dresses
"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner",1,Swim
I can't tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweater/poncho! there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up. i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect! it's a little on the itchy side... but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem. the colors are so gorgeous... deep and rich. love this piece!,1,Fine gauge
"I am 5'2""  120lbs. and bought the 4 petite  which is what i normally wear  and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good  not great  and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment  but for me  the style  the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles  at least not before washing  turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it  but found i",1,Dresses
"It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made  has a fun pattern  and fits great.  i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.  the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile",1,Sweaters

I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho  flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!,1,Blouses

When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it  upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places  the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!,1,Jackets
"This dress is quite lovely in person  but it runs very small  particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium)  but i had a hard time getting into this  and the top was literally about 10"" from being able to zip up. granted  i have a larger than average bust  but that's still excessive  and the fabric has no give whatsoever.  the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s",1,Dresses
This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending  it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!,1,Dresses
I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.,1,Fine gauge
So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater  but so light that you can wear it for summer.,1,Knits
Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty  complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.,1,Knits

I love this dress  the print is beautiful  the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me  this is an exception.    i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me  which i think i like more than if it were a midi.    the armholes do cut in  i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.    my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care  i'm wea,1,Dresses

Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size  but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable.,1,Blouses
This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included  but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return ,1,Blouses
"This is great. on the model it looks largish  but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10""  155  32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days  and more colors would be great. thanks  retailer.",1,Knits
This tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable. it is a bit loose  but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body. i lose my waist a little bit in this  but think it's a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage.,1,Knits

Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.,1,Lounge
I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it  but i won't i'll just wear for errands and lounging  better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad  the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.,1,Knits
"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",1,Blouses
Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me  although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.,1,Dresses
When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.,1,Blouses

This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.,1,Dresses

I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,1,Dresses

This is a great fun dress! it's very unique and well built. my only complaint is that the colors are not the same in the photo. the real colors are black on top and a bright red with shiny torquoise thread running through it. it's still gorgeous!,1,Dresses
This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said  it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style  so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.,1,Knits
The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!,1,Knits

You won't break the bank with this cute tee. loved that it's not a thin fabric. the variation in the stripes adds interest  too. i ordered a large  my regular size  and it fit well. i returned because it was a bit on the long side on my short frame  the colors didn't suit me and i need long sleeve tees now that we're heading into the colder months.,1,Knits

This is very cute. it's lined  it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees  which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!,1,Skirts

This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style  with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off  it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.,1,Fine gauge
This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas  the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly  i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality  unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.,1,Swim

Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight  can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs  folding the collar  wrapping or unwrapping  etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized  it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.,1,Jackets

Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair  these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long  so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend  i'd go with these!,1,Jeans

This top is my favorite spring item. the color is a soft petal  but it doesn't wash me out (i'm a sandy paleface)  and the details make it special. the cut is a little wide (i sized down)  but it's also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt. it's really a find.,1,Knits

I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality  the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down  i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b,1,Outerwear

This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette  so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand  and,1,Jackets

The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge
I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print  but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on  however  i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin  young girls  but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats  the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore,1,Blouses

I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown,1,Jeans

Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting  so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight  the length is a not-too-short above knee  the tiered layers swing so nicely  and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o,1,Dresses

I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!  often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.  the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.  true to size however  the chest/bust runs a little big.,1,Dresses
First of all  this jean fits really well  but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere.  second  the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me.  meanwhile  the styling with the,1,Jeans

I'm very happy with this sweater--it's very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch. the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily. by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy.,1,Sweaters

After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend. i'm usually leery with the length of swing dresses  for instance the endora swing dress (paper crown) is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing. either way  i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue.     typically  i take a size 0 or xs in retailer clothing. i ordered a size 0 petite and,1,Dresses

I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.,1,Fine gauge

For me  the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier  to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall  this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t,1,Dresses

This dress must be pinned on the model in the picture. i ordered a small although i really needed a petite small  but it was sold out. it is incredibly billowy. very billowy. i love the print and the material but this dress is just so very voluminous. i may have it professionally shortened since i am only 5' and the dress hits just below my knees. i'm hoping that helps since i'd really love to keep it.,1,Dresses
Looks great with skinny jeans  leggings  trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.,1,Sweaters
I fell in love with this piece when i saw it in store a few months ago. when there was 25% off dresses  i decided to pull the trigger and ordered it online. since i didn't try it on back then  i ordered my usual petite size 10  but found it to be too big. it's too bad i had to return it because it's a beautifully designed dress. i like the neckline  rouching on the side of the bodice  the lining and slim silhouette. the dress is very stretchy. i found that i could take big strides comfortably in,1,Dresses
I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste  but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami  but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets  so i'm not terribly concerned.,1,Layering
I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts  leggings  trousers  jeans...with a vest  jacket  or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy  it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule,1,Blouses

The lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up. you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords  as well as a fitted skirt. the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight  nor too loose. i usually wear a small and the small fit the best. i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit  the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms.,1,Fine gauge

I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,1,Blouses

1st  this jacket fits true to size. 2nd  the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing)  as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material  so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.    i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility.,1,Outerwear

I purchased in the raspberry  love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool  and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.,1,Fine gauge

I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result  the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.,1,Trend

I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well  today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft  light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a,1,Sleep

This dress is cute and the a line style is quite flattering. a few minor issues: fabric is linen not denim as the name states  petite sizing is still a little large and back zipper doesn't zip down far enough to step into so has to be pulled over head (not that big of a deal). for reference i'm 5'4  120  32d and i ordered a petite size 4 and it was a bit large and fell bellow my knees. will be returning for a size 2. fingers crossed!,1,Dresses

Really nice  substantial  fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size  maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes  go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price  which is why i dropped one star  i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.,1,Outerwear

My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this  but i thought it was cute and springy.    i tried on a large first  since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders.

"I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7"" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red.",1,Pants
I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely  though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.,1,Blouses
This dress is seriously gorgeous  and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy   pear shaped  and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric  fit and style of this dress.,1,Dresses
I really liked the beautiful fabric  design  and length of the piece.,1,Blouses
I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!,1,Knits
I loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my 34 dd chest so back it goes. the zipper had one spot where it was tight  right at the widest part of my rib cage. it was fine every where else. too bad.,1,Dresses
Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist  which i like. however  now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).,1,Skirts
This dress is gorgeous. the quality is high  runs true to size  and is very flattering! my only issue is the tule. i already have hips  so the tule makes the dress over-flare. i am going to have the tailor remove the tule and it will be perfect. for those who are not an hourglass shape naturally  this will help provide the extra shaping.  overall  i love this dress and will be keeping it.,1,Dresses
I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants  but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.,1,Jeans
This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover  but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.,1,Lounge
Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.,1,Blouses
This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play  can't wait to pair with booties into fall.,1,Dresses
Super cute pants  fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist  and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however  when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them.,1,Jeans
Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.,1,Blouses
Love this shirt  very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric  but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.,1,Blouses
