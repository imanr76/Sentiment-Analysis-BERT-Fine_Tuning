Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit,0,Dresses
I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer  unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this  and in my mind  that defeats the purpose of a lightweight  sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.,0,Blouses
"I was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit  it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and",0,Outerwear
Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot,0,Fine gauge
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,0,Jeans
I love how these jeans look on. tts  adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.,0,Jeans
Sheer and lightweight. perfect for summer. great detail could not justify paying full price.,0,Blouses
I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day,0,Sweaters
Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...,0,Blouses
"If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway.",0,Jeans
I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee,0,Knits

I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering  in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,0,Dresses
I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.,0,Dresses
Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.,0,Skirts
This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however  the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't  so it's going back.,0,Blouses
The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband  mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips  they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue  i would keep the trousers  as they are comfortable and pretty  and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through  as i feared.,0,Pants
Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.,0,Knits
So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!,0,Jeans
When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.,0,Knits
I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun  uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said  there are two issues i wish i had known about  although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also  the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr,0,Dresses

This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.,0,Blouses
After the reviews about sizing  i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly  the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said  the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big  it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide  crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the,0,Blouses
"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",0,Blouses
I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the,0,Blouses
I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side  but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge.

"Tried this on at my local retailer  the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra  this is a deal-breaker for me  it can't be fixed.",0,Knits
This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r,0,Dresses
I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut  but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.,0,Dresses
Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!,0,Blouses
This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length  color  and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online  so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed  but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice  and the color is lovely.,0,Dresses
"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also  it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.",0,Knits

I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand  broad shouldered  slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.  i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice  though a bit thin for winter time.,0,Dresses

I just tried on this dress in the store  in red  and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however  the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips  causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than,0,Dresses
I tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.  unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.  first  it runs small than the regular size.   it feels even smaller because my size is xs.  in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line.  i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is.  if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool.  however  if you have thin postur,0,Knits

I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping,0,Shorts

Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb  34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect  the top is huge  especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however  the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.,0,Dresses

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend

Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on,0,Blouses

This t is a beautiful color  and i wish it had worked. it is quite flimsy  however - very thin cotton fabric  without the nice drape that would have made this look good on. i also think it should have been cut a little longer; it flares out right at the hips so instead of covering them  it highlights them. i'm disappointed  and am returning it.,0,Knits

I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.,0,Knits

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend

It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,0,Dresses
I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl,0,Pants

Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.,0,Dresses
This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,0,Jackets

But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.,0,Knits

What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.,0,Knits
This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle,0,Pants
This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.  all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.,0,Dresses
The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.,0,Blouses
I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice  light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification  however  it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist  larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips  but does very little to show off my waist. overall  it is just ok.,0,Dresses

Lightweight  airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker  higher quality silk. the waist has a tight  wide  elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.,0,Skirts

Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.,0,Dresses

I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.,0,Skirts

Well  this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event  but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either  although the lace is nice.,0,Blouses

I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!,0,Lounge

Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.,0,Blouses

The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.,0,Dresses

This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily  when i wore it  i ended up with several tears in the threads  leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings  my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad  and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn  simply because it would last a lot longer.,0,Knits

I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it  but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash  it would help it. after washing  it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt  but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.,0,Knits

I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however  i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one  but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product  especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.,0,Pants

I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried,0,Dresses
This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big. this went back  will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp.,0,Knits

I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,0,Dresses
I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c,0,Lounge
This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.,0,Dresses

I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.,0,Knits

I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0,Sleep
I wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back. upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing. secondly  it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference  i ordered the 3  and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.,0,Knits

The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but  it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.,0,Dresses
That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.,0,Knits

This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist,0,Dresses

I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.,0,Knits

I bought this shirt in a l  since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone  unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy  but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.,0,Knits

"Ref: 5'4""  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.",0,Dresses

I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(,0,Blouses
Was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.,0,Dresses
I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,0,Intimates

I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses

Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,0,Fine gauge
The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means  if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right  it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart  so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also  this skirt fir true to size  it wasn't tight  just gappy.,0,Skirts
Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice  heavy knit-like material  but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.,0,Dresses
I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.,0,Pants

After reading all the reviews  i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso,0,Dresses

I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!,0,Pants

I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.,0,Blouses

This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable,0,Swim
I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,0,Dresses

I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,0,Dresses
Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.,0,Jeans
Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.,0,Knits
The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.,0,Knits

Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but  they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem  but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also  while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest  almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent,0,Dresses

"I am 5'8""  140lbs  pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly  just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic  and there is no unflattering poofing  which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw  however  is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it",0,Skirts

I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice  just too much fabric for me. returning!,0,Knits
I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful  i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff  so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume  the sleeve is not set in  it is a raglan style  that on me looked more like a bat suit  than what i was hoping for  a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the,0,Dresses
This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,0,Layering

This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,0,Pants
Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material  fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller  thinner bods.,0,Knits
I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.,0,Trend
This is the perfect peplum. it floats a bit but doesn't stick out and is super flattering. that's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off  and the peplum pleat is crooked. geeze retailer. this is why i can't justify buying much of anything unless it's on sale. quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill.,0,Knits

Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great  and the overall look is so lovely. however  i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also  the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however  the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes  so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.,0,Dresses
I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust  and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee  but sadly  that wasn't the case.,0,Knits
Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,0,Dresses
I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short  and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.,0,Blouses
I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.,0,Dresses
Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!,0,Dresses
I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well.,0,Dresses
"This denim dress is best worn by someone over 5' 8"". i had to spend a lot to have it taken up and it still doesn't look that great. so if you don't want to pay over $200 once altered  do not buy this dress.    the best part of the dress is the top. it was true to size on top.",0,Dresses

This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress  which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it.,0,Dresses
I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.,0,Dresses

I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!,0,Blouses

I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.,0,Dresses

Super cut but easily wrinkles. eg. i ironed it  got dressed  then bent down to tie my daughters shoe and the whole front bottom was super wrinkly. i thought that it'd go away but it didn't... just got worse by the time i got out of my car at work... front and back were noticeably wrinkled all day.,0,Blouses
I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.,0,Dresses

These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.,0,Pants
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!,0,Trend
This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.,0,Fine gauge
Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.,0,Blouses
Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,0,Lounge
Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.,0,Sweaters
This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person  though the back was gorgeous  with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online  but was a bit more green in person. also  the armholes were very low  so it would need a camisole or no bra.,0,Knits

A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.,0,Fine gauge
I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times  hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.,0,Blouses
I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however  each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings  i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally  the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall  if you are very careful  this is an amazing dress  but i did return it because of its delicate nature.,0,Dresses

Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea,0,Dresses

The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.,0,Dresses

This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame  which is pretty thin  it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous  but the lack of shape made this a no.,0,Dresses

Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,0,Dresses

I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.,0,Knits

I love the colors in this top  but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.,0,Knits
This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0,Dresses

Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.,0,Dresses
Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!,0,Knits

I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.,0,Jeans
It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.,0,Trend
Honestly  the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops  and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short  but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it  because it is really a lovely top.,0,Fine gauge
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.,0,Dresses
Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.,0,Blouses

I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.,0,Dresses

I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0,Dresses

I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress,0,Dresses

The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however  the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.,0,Dresses
The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it's going back.,0,Dresses

I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,0,Blouses

I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however  while i liked the irregular hemline on the model  on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern  definitely no dryer on this one.,0,Knits

Ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but  the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.,0,Dresses
This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.,0,Blouses

Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,0,Outerwear

The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.,0,Blouses

It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0,Blouses
While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!),0,Swim

I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.,0,Outerwear

This is a fantastic dress for fall  if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l  rather than in particular dress sizes  so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give)  but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo)  with a tightness at the clavicle  and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.    i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season ,0,Dresses

Gorgeous fun dress  but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra  but i think its a winner for someone.,0,Dresses

"First of all i need to state that i am 5 1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel  it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan  there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c",0,Sweaters

Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,0,Dresses
I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.,0,Blouses
I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't  it is very heavy  much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice  the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance  easily. back it went  boo hoo. if you are between sizes  i would size down  runs a bit big.,0,Dresses
I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.,0,Knits
I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.,0,Dresses
Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top,0,Lounge
I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms  i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me  this was a no go :(,0,Lounge

At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.,0,Knits
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0,Blouses

The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,0,Knits

I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!,0,Sweaters
This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck  the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.,0,Knits
"Wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes. i am 5'7""  160lbs  34dddd  and the size large was the correct size.",0,Knits
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,0,Swim

I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.,0,Dresses

This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso  but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion  though  so not sure if its just me and my complex. if you don't have a short torso then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.  overall  i am not sure who this was designed for.. but,0,Pants
Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over,0,Blouses
Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d  and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.,0,Blouses

This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,0,Knits

I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,0,Shorts

This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!,0,Pants

I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel  color (grey) and style of the dress  but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.,0,Dresses

The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,0,Shorts
Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length  too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering  particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person  way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.,0,Knits

I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.,0,Dresses
Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.,0,Knits

I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.,0,Lounge

"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",0,Intimates

I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex,0,Knits
Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split  so any movement reveals most of your arm  shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes  i could wear a sweater or blazer with it  but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why  retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc.  but the split sleeves make it a no-go.,0,Knits

I didn't have any problems with the fit  i love the puffin pattern  the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length  or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it  so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but  yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short  please.,0,Blouses

This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.,0,Knits

I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also  the fit is loose  maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.,0,Dresses

It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.,0,Knits

I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed,0,Dresses
Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.,0,Dresses
I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.,0,Dresses

I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately  this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big  it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump  but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.,0,Knits
This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.,0,Knits

This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses

First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.,0,Skirts

So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!,0,Dresses

I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.,0,Dresses

"I saw this in that postcard ""catalog"" and it drew my attention immediately  so when i saw it at the store  i knew i would try it on.  this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things  the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy  but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee  so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring",0,Dresses

Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first  the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it. online  the orange looks completely different ,0,Blouses
I really  really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty  and the front was flattering  but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly  i sent it back.,0,Dresses

Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.,0,Lounge

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa,0,Sweaters
The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy  too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.,0,Blouses
It's like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it. very sad to return this.,0,Trend
These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?,0,Lounge
This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,0,Jackets

I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).,0,Dresses
Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,0,Shorts
I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow,0,Skirts

It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester  slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.,0,Blouses

This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,0,Fine gauge
I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink. the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso  so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body... the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s)  it covered my flat hips  fits just like the picture  but now my hips are showing :( i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.,0,Knits

I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body. also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly  these are going back.,0,Pants
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,0,Blouses

I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.,0,Dresses
This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust  but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust  although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.,0,Knits
I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite  one 00. the style  color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall  however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.,0,Dresses

This hoodie is beautiful  soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will.

This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).,0,Knits

I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.,0,Knits
Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.,0,Blouses

I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup  so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love,0,Dresses

Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,0,Jackets

Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric  and has perfect fit  nice arm length  looks good on the hanger  the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded  in the mail  so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket  tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put,0,Knits
I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw,0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out,0,Dresses

This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,0,Blouses
I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it  so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because  yes  this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.    the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long  you end up clingi,0,Dresses

The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how,0,Dresses

Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,0,Fine gauge

Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s,0,Blouses
I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.,0,Blouses

This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0,Dresses
I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.,0,Blouses

Normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it. secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra  too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle,0,Dresses

I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.,0,Dresses

These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.    they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.    when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way,0,Lounge

I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.,0,Dresses

Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,0,Sweaters

I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,0,Jackets

Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.,0,Skirts

This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount  i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.,0,Dresses
I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives,0,Blouses

I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer  and this is not it. like others  it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps  but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.    - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however ,0,Knits
I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!,0,Knits
Oh how i wanted this skirt to work.... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful. the style is very nice. the knit is comfortable. but... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away. after wearing it for an hour  the front slit was curling in weird directions. the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y. i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips.,0,Skirts
I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!,0,Knits

This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses
But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.,0,Dresses

I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also  it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem  i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.,0,Outerwear

The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model  maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers  and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again  could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy  ill just have to make it work.,0,Knits

I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.,0,Dresses

As much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online  i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.,0,Dresses
Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!,0,Knits

"This shirt is enormous and  as the title of my review suggests  it looks like a men's button down. the fabric is quite sheer  but that's actually what i liked best about it. i just looked completely shapeless in this top & wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it. perhaps if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i might have liked it better - it didn't fit anything like the model photos suggest - it's huge. not ""easy/slouchy"".",0,Blouses
Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,0,Jackets

I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.,0,Fine gauge

This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.,0,Dresses
If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,0,Dresses
Ordered these in 31p last year  prob could have worn a 30p  ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit.   this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.,0,Jeans

I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,0,Lounge

After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,0,Blouses
This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,0,Layering
"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!",0,Dresses

This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,0,Knits

The dress had great potential  but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately  i had to return it. the length was great  and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust  and it didn't work for me.,0,Dresses

This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,0,Sweaters

I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea  but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model  so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me  because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful  the pink is more a blush and washed me out  the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t,0,Knits

I agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin .......  it runs really big  it's short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture.  colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.  fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn.  i haven't one positive thing to say about t,0,Blouses

It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back. not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat,0,Dresses
I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist,0,Dresses
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts,0,Blouses
I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.,0,Skirts
I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy  so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all  its a fun dress!,0,Dresses

I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.,0,Knits

I had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3  105lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.,0,Dresses

I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.,0,Outerwear

I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so  when you wear the necessary base layer  the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea,0,Knits

I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.,0,Blouses
I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,0,Jackets
I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful  however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long  so additional hemming required  otherwise fit was true to size (5'3  130 lbs  size 6p),0,Dresses
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,0,Knits
I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters

The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.,0,Knits
I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma,0,Sweaters
I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.,0,Dresses

The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.,1,Knits
I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up. i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again. luckily  i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isn't always easy when working with jersey.  that said  i really like the dress otherwise. it's super soft and i think i'll get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on.,1,Dresses

I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality  and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray)  which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size  it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8'  and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer  but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look.,1,Blouses
This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric  the top is a little thin  but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer  but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress  but not enough to dissuade me.,1,Dresses

Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats  and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured  so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!,1,Legwear
This dress is super cute. good quality. from the front it is very flattering and hangs well. from the side and back it looks huge. i ordered a size 4 and i am a normal 6 or 8. i have re-ordered the 0 and size 2 to see if there is less material (others have mentioned that the arms are smaller in the smaller size. my trouble area is my hips so i don't think this will be an issue as i am quite small on top). if not i will have it altered because it is so cute and can be worn many different ways.,1,Dresses
The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress.   the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch  i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.    this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines,1,Dresses

I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool. my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.,1,Dresses

I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo  i knew i had to try it on. once i did  i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.,1,Dresses

"Recently bought these on sale  though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4  the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model  but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas  and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy  as sometimes happens with this style.",1,Pants

This is an awesome vest - so soft  cozy  and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did  i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.,1,Fine gauge
I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs  i'm 5'4 130lbs  34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.,1,Dresses
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!,1,Knits
"I really liked this dress when i tried the navy on in the store. i am 5'4""  140 lb. and the medium fit me really well. unfortunately  i am not comfortable showing a lot of leg so the dress was just too short for me. if it had come to the tops of my knees i would have gone for it but it was well above my knees. the fit and color were great though  i loved the neckline and the material was very soft and comfortable. i tried the large but  while it was a little longer  the larger size made it lose",1,Dresses

Ordered this dress online  and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist  but for the most part  the dress fit very well and was very flattering  may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips  and,1,Dresses
It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy  but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it  but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.,1,Dresses
Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms  and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size  is beautiful  and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically  but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all  but is thick enough to be seamless.,1,Swim
The green is terrific  and the pleat in the back makes the top flows nicely. great if you have some muffin top to hide (like me). and the details across the shoulders and back makes it more interesting than just a t. i'm concern about the quality of fabric. lately there's much rayon mix and they tend to pill or wear out and get holes after washing.,1,Knits
I bought these on sale for a great price online without seeing in person and was pleased to find that they are very versatile  could be very casual or great for weekend shopping  etc . the purple is a great shade and the fit is great. i'm 135 pound for reference and i purchased the size 28.,1,Pants

This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter  though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose  but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.,1,Knits
This is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline. however  it seems to run small on top. i can not zip up the top by myself (zipper is in the back) even though i usually wear a size 2 or xs in this brand (i'm a 32d so i'm narrow on top). i haven't decided yet if i'm keeping it because despite the sizing issue  the dress is lovely!,1,Dresses
I bought this shirt in the rust color along with the blue/black sweater skirt after seeing it on display in the store. not sure i would have ever put those 2 together but i love the outfit. i'm not much of a shirt-tucker  either  but this shirt works either way. tucked in a skirt or more casual with jeans. my only criticism is the static cling in the front  as mentioned by another reviewer. i had thought of getting it in white  but if it's shear  then maybe not. haven't been wearing a tank under,1,Knits

I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful  the cotton/silk blend is delicious  and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted  since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.,1,Blouses

This top is lovely; great colors for spring  light material  flow-y  and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand)  so larger chested women may want to size up  but it's well worth it,1,Blouses

"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft  love the flowiness  and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size).",1,Knits
Cute skirt and print  but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture  but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.,1,Skirts

The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality  then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit  i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!,1,Intimates
The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately  these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for,1,Shorts

Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.,1,Knits
The color  heft  style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.,1,Jeans
Got this for my daughter who lives out of town. i plan on bringing it to her during my next visit. i love it! the style is up to date and pretty. it's a perfect dress for almost any occasion! i'm hoping it will fit her  but the sizing looks right to me and the quality is great!,1,Dresses
Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs  even tho i am an xs petite (5'2  107 lb  32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate  and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up  it hides the bagginess a little  but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves.  s,1,Dresses
This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down  favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls  these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in  no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt  which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and don't require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans  for me. with all that said  these are not a 5 star version of,1,Jeans
I bought the design which has now sold out  of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but  it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.    this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus  i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.,1,Knits
These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased  and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.,1,Jeans
This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,1,Pants
For me  the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier  to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall  this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t,1,Dresses

"I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too ""short."" the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them.",1,Shorts
I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.,1,Sweaters
A classy t-shirt - can go from work to casual.  the gray and mauve were both drab in color and hard to pair with neutral dress pants.  i chose the white. it definitely runs large  so size down (i.e. wear m/l  chose s).  the fabric is linen  very itch  so tank is probably needed underneath.  flattering fit for curvy figure.,1,Knits
At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer  i realized it was similar  but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it  and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful  the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two  and whether worn with skinny jeans  as shown  or wide leg trousers (as the haute,1,Fine gauge

The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it  the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of,1,Sweaters
I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs. it runs a tad large. this is a beautiful garment. i receive many  many compliments every time i wear it. in fact  nearly everyone comments on it. it is surprisingly warm for a cape. i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters. as others have mentioned  the buttons are a little difficult  but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings. i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up. i actually like the collar down,1,Outerwear
I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great true to size i am xsmall-small for reference  purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater  or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!,1,Blouses
"I love the colors. originally purchased a large for my broad shoulders and it was too big and too long for 5'4"". exchanged it for a petit medium and it fits great. will have to wait for cooler days to wear it since it is a heavy cotton and the weather is still very hot intexas.",1,Blouses
Usually wear a small  sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small  if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws  so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great  medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.,1,Knits
"I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs  small frame.",1,Dresses
Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear  not fussy  no special bra needed.,1,Blouses
Skirt fits true to size  i bought a regular size 2 even though im only 5 feet because i didnt want it too short. the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee. bold  vibrant color and great quality! also very unique  which is what i look for at ahtro. recommend  give it a shot!,1,Skirts
These were not tts  imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad  but b/c these have no stretch  they were not comfy  like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy  the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !,1,Pants
"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy  i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night  more of a cab to curb piece.",1,Sweaters
This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am  you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.,1,Knits
I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow)  but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2  and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!,1,Dresses
This is a lovely  well-fitting  embroidered  navy tank  i cannot find a flaw in this. i am 5'5  142 lbs.  34d and the size 6 is a fantastic fit. one of those tops that is so well-cut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing. the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse. it has a small cut-out in the back at the v. it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatile-it can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt. six stars!,1,Blouses
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!,1,Jackets
I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model  and i'm pretty small on top.  overall  nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site,1,Knits
"I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!",1,Jeans
Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price  i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms  but they are good enough.,1,Knits
I am 5'3 and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite. the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect. i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter. the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,1,Dresses
I love this pullover. i felt it was a little wide at the bottom but i received lots of compliments on it. i ordered a large because i did not want it tight around the bust (i wear a 36j bra) and biceps but i think i would have been fine in a medium.,1,Fine gauge
I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large  i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing.

I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter! thanks antro!!,1,Pants
I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews. i'm so happy i did! i couldn't be happier with the fit  quality and design. for reference  i am 5'8  size 4 and smaller chested (small b cup) and went with a medium. i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it!,1,Swim
I was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombrã© silk pants that i had tailored to fit. but everytime i put these pants on i couldn't find any top to come close to match..especially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look. well this top fits that perfectly and i'm excited to pair them for a nice dinner out. plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals.,1,Knits
Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,1,Blouses
I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then  i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd  i can't even explain it.,1,Knits
I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on  but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite  but surprise  it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on  whcich i did yesterday. mistake  because i love it  and even if it is not peite  it workedc (with heels)  and online it already says only a few left  so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.  cut is very flattering  and colors are great. also can be worn any seas,1,Dresses
"I tried the ""neutral motif"" one on when it first came out. i didn't buy but it stayed on my mind b/c the colors were so pretty. i got it at sale on sale and am so happy i did! it is sheer but i think it would work fine in a casual setting without a tank as long as you have a skin tone bra. great buy and tts.",1,Knits
Lovely holiday blouse  flows at the bottom but doesn't bell out like some tunic blouses. the arms aren't cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish. charming and romantic.,1,Knits

Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered  voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting.   i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble.,1,Dresses
I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it  it's the cutest suit ever.,1,Swim
Love these shorts. they do run large  i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green  and not as bright as what i see in the online photo  but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.,1,Shorts
Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing  and even more so with some boots. love it. also  its more gray than blue  although i like that.,1,Sleep
These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.,1,Jeans
I love this top so much i tried it on twice. because i forgot why it didn't work the first time: i have a chest. i'm just a c cup  but i looked lumpy and matronly in this top. if that's not an issue for you  i think you'll love it.,1,Knits
This sweater carries alot of weight  more than it appeared. the yellow is more of a bright green/yellow- not a soft color as pictured. it is still a nice layering piece.,1,Sweaters
Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring  summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!,1,Knits
I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy  and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes  but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me.,1,Blouses
I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color  perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath  but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.,1,Blouses
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,1,Lounge
I saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small. i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing. i am 5'6 110 for reference. found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on. the reviewers were right! i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short. the small fit perfectly. it was a bit longer too. great style and soft fabric. once you size up  you'll love it...,1,Knits
I decided on these last minute for a date last night and let me say...i looked hot. :) they are super cute and flattering (im slender  but hey  im also 53) and could be dressed up or down easily. the but is because when i got home i realized that i had ruined my new gel manicure from the black die! it comes off so easily that you should be cautious of your car seats  sofa  etc. i made the mistake of not washing first  but do! hopefully thats enough to help because these are great leggings.,1,Pants

This dress is gorgeous. the fabric is thick and layered with well designed lines. since the fabric is thick  it gives very little around your body. i have wide hips  a big butt and bust so this dress unfortunately was not a good fit for me. i usually fit in a 6 petite and for this one i got an 8. it fit around my bust and hips  but was bunched up in the back. i would definitely at least give this dress a try because it was very beautiful.,1,Dresses

This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy  feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully  i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful,1,Fine gauge

I love the way this dress looks on me. it skims my figure to hide my flaws  the bright embroidery is eye catching  the layers flow when i walk  it's a great midi length and it doesn't make me look wider in profile.  i'm not having the see-through issue since the patterns are busy and my lingerie matches.  i purchased 10 petite and my measurements are 39-28-35.       my dilemma is three fold: the material is polyester & rayon  causing some uncomfortable heat to generate when sitting. then there's,1,Dresses

I was skeptical when i saw it online. i was not sure about the white background. but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online. i ordered s and xs. i was really surprised how well this dress fits. i am 5.4 and about 126 lbs  pear shape. the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy. the cut is slimming  flattering and structured. i decided to keep the xs size. i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer.,1,Dresses

I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely  but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.,1,Knits
Retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint. i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants. the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you can't tell by looking at the photo. i didn't mind it and thought it was actually a plus! i just think it is a bit too expensive  because although it is nice quality  i don't feel it is worth the price tag. pretty,1,Blouses

First  i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering  forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it  and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together,1,Knits

This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.,1,Dresses
I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes,1,Dresses

I love this tunic. the fit is just lovely for me--i'm a large busted  muscular shouldered woman who wears a 4-6 on the bottom. the 8 fit perfectly across my chest (34ddd) without horrid  gaping armpits. and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in front--not easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl! i also love the cut and flow--it is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels  but also cute with flat sandals for a day o,1,Blouses

This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up  it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached  the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer  soft and smooth  and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking  from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t,1,Dresses

Deletta has done it again  designed a top that is unique  flattering  and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of,1,Knits

This dress is very pretty. i love it! people are not kidding about the buttons! i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived. unfortunately  both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag. it was on sale so i'm guessing they were lost before shipping. i love the dress enough to keep it. it will not be that big of a deal to replace them. besides the buttons  the dress is a very nice quality. it is lined and has a nice weight to it. i'm obsessed with rifle paper co. so i,1,Dresses

I was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left  so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear  and it did. this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far. i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short  it was a good call. i'm sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldn't have felt comfortable in a medium's length. plus i tend to like the oversized look. i paired it with some slouchy socks and,1,Dresses

I must be the lone dissenter  but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp  as it does run wide. however  with skinny jeans or slim pants  this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone  but it's one of my faves right now.,1,Jackets

I rarely write reviews  but this one deserves one. this top is completely  utterly  adorable! it flows so beautifully  which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party  and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand  and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!,1,Blouses
"I ordered this in xs  i'm 5'4""  around 115lbs  and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft  but not see-through  and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours  i'd buy more!",1,Sleep

I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly  but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear  the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted  my inner thighs touch when i walk  but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown,1,Jeans
This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review  i ordered a small  and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!,1,Knits

I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine  but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but  i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me  still fitted at the waist (27inches)  but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.,1,Jackets

Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo  even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux  i took an xs  whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo  although much looser on me.,1,Knits

I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!,1,Fine gauge

Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store  it looked more navy than black  but as i have it home  it is definite,1,Dresses
I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.,1,Sweaters
So soft and pretty  but the fit is off on me. i'm an xs/0 and the seam on this hits right across my bust. with the 3/4 length sleeves it makes the whole thing look like it shrunk in the wash. on my pre-teen daughter however it looks perfect  so i guess i'd say size up if you have boobs!,1,Fine gauge
I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb  heavy and glossy  good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete,1,Lounge

I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it  the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person.,1,Jackets

Several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles. it is not embroidered  but an attractive popsicle print. i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p. a bit roomy in waist  but with tie at waist it works. length great  but arm holes large. will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering.,1,Dresses
I absolutely love slips  and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans  i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses  and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough,1,Sleep

These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold  green  and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs   5 foot 7  and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out  but i haven't found that to be a real problem.,1,Jeans
If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans  then you'll love this one! the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that you'll wonder if you should've bought a smaller size. it's also a great length for fall/winter and looks fabulous with boots. i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back!,1,Skirts
Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.,1,Dresses

"I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7"" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red.",1,Pants
"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.",1,Blouses

Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top  something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.,1,Knits
I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops  but went with the small so it wouldn't be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall!,1,Fine gauge
Super soft  cap sleeves  shirt tail hem and double stitched seams. mine is the grey/green motif and tts. i bought (s) 34-b and the fit was perfect. the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the grey/green motif. the blue/pink motif feels more like summer.,1,Knits

This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,1,Sweaters
I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite,1,Dresses

The shape is flattering on my postpartum body. even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest  the swing shape hides my stomach area. the material doesn't seem particularly breathable  so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot  humid weather; but for my summers in the pacific northwest  it'll be fine.,1,Knits
My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower  and of all the lingerie i received that day  this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.,1,Intimates
Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.,1,Outerwear

Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft  and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty  not too bright  and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading  and it was much longer on me than on the model  though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair.,1,Dresses
This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!,1,Dresses

Very soft  first thing i have to say  but runs a little big  especially in the sleeves  i ordered the xxs p and the sleeves still bunch a lot at the wrists. also  other bummer is how sheer the ivory fabric is  i wish it had more substance for the price. but  i like the style and color combo. classic look  effortless  and can be paired with so many things. the regular size neckline was too low for me. the length on the petite was fine  not too short. so i say it runs big.    for reference  i am 1,1,Fine gauge
I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also  i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!,1,Knits

Very cute  very flattering. the peplum is fairly subtle and really works  falling at just the right place for me (i'm 5'5). i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans. the color is deep and works well with my pale skin. the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time - always an issue with sweaters.  unlike some of the other reviewers  i found it ran slightly large. i am small framed but large-chested and often take a medium in sweaters  but a small is roomy o,1,Fine gauge

Love this  but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory  winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do  really it's not.    that said  i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right ,1,Knits

Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others  i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.,1,Dresses
So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that  yet i'm not sending it back:),1,Knits
I love this top. the design is very good  i love the pleats at the back  and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l  which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style  with fitted pants it would work well.,1,Blouses

I bought this top in slate. it is very nice  looks so flattering and good with a light pant. it runs large though and is loose fitting  like a swing top. i like the design at the top. i will try the mauve in the store. i really like this top and recommend it for casual wear. very comfortable and soft.,1,Knits

Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric  the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan  jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-,1,Lounge

"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric  and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless  i love this dress and would definitely recommend!",1,Dresses
I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up  and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible  with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect  and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality  and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft  and gives a tiny bit of stretch  but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u,1,Blouses

The material is different than i expected  but i like it a lot. the dress is extremely tight fitting  i will be returning it if i can't figure something out. i'm a 36d and wear a 6  very very restricting in the chest/shoulder area. unfortunately  it may just not be designed for my body type. getting the dress on was for sure one of my hardest workouts...and i crossfit. oh  and the bow does not come off at all  so good luck with that. the red color is gorgeous  i hope it works out.,1,Dresses
I received this dress yesterday and it exceeded expectations! i was not expecting the fabric to have a slight stretch and felt that the fabrication aided to the overall comfort of the dress without losing any of the quirky elegance. due to the stretch  however  i immediately ordered a size down for comparison. i'm a pretty solid 2 with eva franco dresses but with this cut i had about an inch of fabric in the waist. regardless  i'm keeping the dress - jury is just still out on which side!! measur,1,Dresses

This top is true to size for me  i'm 5'8'' 128lbs  and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big  i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms  the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect  i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel,1,Blouses
I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer  but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware  this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge,1,Blouses

This is a perfect dress for summer in florida. it does run larger than it needs to be  even for a swing dress. no problem  i took in the sides several inches on each side  and it looks great. it's very easy to pick the stitches on the straps and make them adjustable.it has a nice  lightweight full lining. my new favorite dress.,1,Dresses

This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.,1,Lounge
I love most pure and good clothing pieces  mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts  but i is very  very long and straight up and down. fyi: i have a boyish figure  having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back  so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house  but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out,1,Lounge
The top runs small  it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l  it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy  good looking  and slimming top. i love it!!,1,Knits
These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral  and wore with a black peasant top  sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though  so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model  and after a few hours they were hanging off of me  so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.,1,Pants

I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on  i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress  there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.,1,Dresses
The price was worth the splurge  free shipping and a special discount helped. the minute i laid my eyes on this sweater i was hooked. light  airy weight and that handmade texture make the overall design something special. this is the kind of sweater that has enduring style. the big kangaroo pockets scared me a little  which i have determined to be not a distraction after trying it on.,1,Sweaters

Pilcro runs one size smaller this year - i compared with pants that i ordered last year and sure enough  one inch difference in waist. i did not notice difference in other dimensions of this garment  so my best guess is that pilcro decided to make tighter waist due to some complaints last year about waist being ?too lose?. i personally prefer sporty silhouette and am not thrilled with this change  but pants fit and are nice color and quality  so they stay. however  i am not sure i would order th,1,Pants

Love this! it's loose and easy for summer  fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.,1,Knits
This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me  but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.  if they had additional colors  i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.,1,Blouses

Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress  but as others have said  the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me  i found other dresses that i loved more  this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.,1,Dresses

The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately  this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous  which is never a good feeling. i recommend  but only for tall  slim types with a small bust.,1,Blouses

I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!,1,Knits
This seems like a simple tank  but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam  and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps  coloring is neutral enough  adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on  jsut didn't want t pay full price  but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes  i am usually xs petite and that is gone  so is xxs  so went with xs). i am 115 lbs and 30dd for reference...,1,Knits

Yep. this is snug  so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been,1,Blouses
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,1,Jeans
I'm consistently a 0p in this brand  but i ordered a regular zero  and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it's a bit boxy  and the material is thicker than i thought  but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!,1,Blouses

I love this fabric  it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great. i wish it would be offered in red  like the cowl neck long sleeve tee. with that said  i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd  and while i wish it were a few inches longer (3/4 sleeved). the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality.,1,Knits

This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair  they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so  that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.,1,Blouses

Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.,1,Sleep
I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling,1,Trend
No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.,1,Knits

I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog  but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size  i usually wear 8-10  and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!,1,Blouses
I purchased this piece in store in a size small  ivory. i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect! material is soft  lightweight  and very comfortable. collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look. i'm so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long!!,1,Sweaters
I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit  but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out  but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.,1,Dresses

I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy  so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though  as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer  so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone  but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro,1,Blouses
This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced  in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable  and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7  128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone  since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(,1,Dresses

I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice  the length of the sleeves  adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering  adn i am glad the daker color is at the top  hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking.

This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps  but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe  you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate  it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.,1,Dresses
I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however  when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit  but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length  but make sure you size down.,1,Shorts

I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it  and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear  but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking  i am able to wear my regular bra under it  and the straps don't hang out.,1,Blouses
"Caught my eye at checkout  and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on  which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering  as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture  and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4"" and it came just above the knee in front  while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!",1,Dresses

The photo does not do this dress justice at all. it's a light lavender and extremely flattering. i'm athletic so have broader shoulders and hips  and this is an amazing fit for me. also  the front has a small button to make it more modest  which is closed in the photo of the model  but if you leave it open  va-va-va-voom! so  to summarize: beautiful spring lavender  fabulously feminine fit. get it!,1,Dresses

"There was only a l in store but i tried it as a gauge. given i am normally a xs/0  i knew it was going to be too big but wanted to see if i could get an idea of how it might look in my regular size. it truly is a lovely blouse - gauzy fabric  flowy feel and an easy piece to dress up or down. however the xs was much shorter in the sleeves  (above the wrist bone on me)  and much shorter in the body  (sat at mid pelvis - for ref i am 5'7""). this completely altered the look and i think i would have",1,Blouses
This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely  and i love the little longer sleeves.    beautiful color too!,1,Knits
This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape  so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i can't wait to wear this.,1,Dresses

"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said  they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up  not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts  and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",1,Lounge
This coat is fun  flirty  & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted  but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however  i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it  so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v,1,Outerwear
Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price  but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.,1,Lounge

"Denim is a little heavier than my other pilcro stet jeans  but i love the wash and the broken-in wear on the upper legs and pocket. i mostly appreciate how little they stretch out during the day  just enough to be comfortable but without losing their shape. they seem a bit more fitted in the hips than the waist. but  i prefer jeans that aren't tight in the waist  so these are perfect for me. i purchased the same size as all my other jeans and they fit just fine. i am 5'6"" and the hem fell right",1,Jeans

Love everything about this dress...cut  color  material and price!,1,Dresses
This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions don't look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.,1,Sweaters
I tried this on as a fluke.  i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers.    it is so chic!  it makes your butt look amazing!  i tried it on with nude booties  but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal  or flats.  don't overlook this beauty!!,1,Pants
These chinos are the best.  the fit is always true to size. the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful. my favorite are the plum. these are my go-to pants,1,Pants
I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers  it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well.,1,Skirts
This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be. the zipper works great  the material feels nice  and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect. after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it. i highly recommend this skirt.,1,Skirts
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.,1,Blouses
These are a perfect staple piece: you can dress them up or down  and they're insanely comfortable! even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do  i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being form-fitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you. i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style  because they just fit so well and last a really long time. i will continue to buy these for many  many years!,1,Jeans
It is a really cute sweater. i thought it would be a little longer based on the picture. on me it hits at my waist but i am still okay with it. the design is unique and i am happy with the purchase.,1,Sweaters
Great sweater - heavy without being too warm. great layering piece.,1,Sweaters
I'm not petite  but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places  the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.,1,Lounge

"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to",1,Knits

I really liked these leggings  so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants  i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.,1,Legwear
I agree with the review that says this is better in person than in the pic online. great sale price and super cozy but thin enough to transition to spring!,1,Knits
Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,1,Blouses
Yes  this is a beautiful print and fits perfectly...but it's unlined thin polyester. full price is pretty ludicrous on this one. tts  but might need to size up if you have a larger chest (no stretch). hoping to grab on sale.,1,Dresses

I'm very happy with the interesting print and unusual bib design of this comfortable dress. the bib embroidery is off in some areas. i find that the swath of beige to be too much since it almost matches my skin tone. to break it up  i took the unnecessary waist tie and used it as a bodice trim  creatively knotting  tucking and securing with mini safety pins. i purchased the m petite and though it has a zipper back  i did not have to unzip to put this on or take it off. i have a heavily padded up,1,Dresses
I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year  these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!,1,Shorts
I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair  and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time  i went for the red pair  and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.,1,Pants
"I am a shorter woman (5'3"") and typically a size large. i purchased this dress in a large. it is flattering and fits well. good length as well.",1,Dresses
This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim  and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me  and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on  i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings  shorts  and sandals. such an easy  classic  simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.,1,Knits
I loved this top when i tried it on in the store. i was very close to buying  but i knew my sister would want  so i moved on. it is a great fitting top. i am 5'7  125lbs  and the small fit perfectly. i do question how well this top will fit petite people.,1,Blouses
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.,1,Blouses

They have some stretch  so if you are between sizes  order down. they are very long  which for me is a good thing!,1,Jeans
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!,1,Dresses
I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages  and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems  but they are growing on me.,1,Jeans
This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,1,Jackets

This shirt looked so perfect on the model  and i was so excited to get it! when i received it  it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is  it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me  but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.,1,Knits
Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.,1,Pants
Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material isn't that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.,1,Dresses

I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant  due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise)  but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five  due to the material.,1,Pants
"I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true",1,Sweaters
I was hesitant about buying this at first because i'm busty (f-cup)  but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it. and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it. it's a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots.,1,Knits
I fell in love with these bottoms at first site. i was a little worried they would not work for me because i'm a curvy size 12/14  but to my surprise they look great! i tried on the large as that is what i usually wear at retailer  but i was able to size down to a medium - which was great cause it minmized some of the fullness for me. they are light and breezy and will be the perfect alternative from shorts - which i hate. they are so worth trying!!,1,Pants
I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos  but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it's super soft and well made. it's also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay  but this is a piece that will stay in your closet  and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre,1,Fine gauge

The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom  like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.,1,Fine gauge
I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit,1,Knits

"I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel ""sack-like"". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous.",1,Dresses
I  too  saw this jacket on the recent retailer email teaser and instantly i was in love. i put it in my cart and was contemplating buying it but was unsure on size etc since there was only one review. i came back to find it was no longer available and i was devastated. i was at my local mall today and decided to pop in. much to my delight  they had a rack full of this coveted jacket. it's very cute  stylish  not very thick and the quality was ...just ok. there was a slightly worn look  that perhap,1,Outerwear
I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,1,Blouses
I bought this yesterday in store - i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you.  i typically wear a large and went with a medium.  love the grey color - it will make a nice neutral.  am looking forward to wearing this well into fall/winter as i'm in the south where it takes a while to get cold.,1,Jackets

This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well  but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality  but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.,1,Dresses

Caught my eye because of the colorful graphic print  in my closet because of the super sale price.  it fits as expected in size medium  a little bit long since i'm short.  i'm unsure of the longevity since it's a viscose mix.  feels a little scratchy so if you're sensitive  be aware.  i don't really wear tank tops without layers so this is a great addition to my casual wardrobe.,1,Knits
This top is absolutely adorable  i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring  this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this  get it! you won't regret it.,1,Blouses
Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg  have plenty of length (i'm 5'6  and there is a good inch of extra length)  but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though  but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey  probably a size 31 in jeans right now  and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality,1,Lounge

I really love this piece because it's classic and the style transitions from day-to-night. the color caught my eye first  but once i tried it on  it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me. i felt too comfortable to be stylish  but there i was multi-tasking my full-time passions in the retailer dressing room. no big deal.     i am a tall  size 4/6 woman. for taller girls like me who a) intend to wear a small heel with the piece,1,Pants
Beautiful in white  and beautiful to look at  but as the other reviewer mentioned  the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however  the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition  some of the beading is already coming off  and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad  but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful,1,Blouses
"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit  long and not clingy at all. i love the 80's motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.  the black design was strange - hearts  fox  cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well  but the black ""green"" design was too off.",1,Knits
I usually pick the large size when it comes to fitted jackets but in this case i decided to go with size medium.  i have a broad back and round shoulders and large upper arms.  when i put the size large on  the body of the jacket looked too boxy on me.  the medium is much more flattering but i cannot put a thick layer on underneath.  when the weather gets cooler  i am pairing this with my herbalist dress and my other sleeveless garments.  i am 135# 36d 38/28/35.,1,Outerwear
Just got this top in the mail today  and i love it. i bought the white in a small  and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton  but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined  so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large  as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer  and a lot of summers,1,Blouses
This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one  leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.,1,Dresses
I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those  but after trying both pairs on  i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro  but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8  which is what i seem to we,1,Pants

Love it! cute  flattering  and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.    the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock)  and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it.,1,Sweaters
Runs big  especially if you're on the shorter side - very long on my 5'3: frame  even in extra small. material was thinner than i'd hoped  doesn't look as smooth as on the model. this top will really only look good with leggings - pants with any detail or rear pockets will show through and detract from the look. i do like the sleeve length and rich colors for fall.,1,Knits
Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!,1,Blouses

I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).,1,Dresses
These jeans are so great  i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out  despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!,1,Jeans

"If you are shaped anything like me  you will have to size up quite a bit on this one. i tried it on in my normal size and probably needed to size up 2 or more sizes to get the proper fit. the fabric has no ""give"" and feels a little cheap in my opinion. for your reference  i am a curvy  athletic build with broad shoulders.",1,Dresses

I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all  this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed  because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over  but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week  and,1,Knits
I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites  so i tried a large  and it was tight in the bust  but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.,1,Knits

The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back  as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped  so take care when laundering.,1,Pants
Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes  you might want to size down. if i did order a small  the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer  so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w,1,Blouses

I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.,1,Dresses
I was on the fence about ordering my normal med  but so glad i did. it fits sooo well. i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin. its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels. i don't like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath. this was a great buy especially with the sale.,1,Pants

The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric  sort of like a double knit? but with its own  simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy  but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.,1,Sweaters

I loved this top on the mannequin  so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10  i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..,1,Lounge

This is a cute dress  but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it  i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered  i assumed it was red and black checked  but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors  so it is going back.,1,Dresses

I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,1,Shorts

This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,1,Swim

Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas  so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect  since the colors aren't look too summery  but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy  but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops  this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.,1,Blouses

I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it's basic black  but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer  and it's stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit  depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined  which is a big plus. i was,1,Skirts

I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated  it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion  it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on  i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning  etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it  it will be for its aesthetic...,1,Fine gauge

The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering  classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee  tank  denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.,1,Skirts

In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums  i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft  not too stiff or scratchy  and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece  i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter  too. yay!,1,Blouses

This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some  the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores  but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.,1,Dresses

Yes it is boxy  but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse  charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.  great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.,1,Blouses

I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice  normal sweater  even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great  especially with jeans. the front is short  making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also  the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.,1,Fine gauge
Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink  a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large  depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas  it is,1,Fine gauge
"I first tried this dress in my usual size 4  and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering.  i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a 2  and it was so much better!  very pretty shape.  uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size.  for reference  i'm 5'6""  125 lbs.",1,Dresses

Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3  117 lbs  34 b cup  and took an xs. top fits comfortably  no tightness around the chest  and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through  so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet  so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!,1,Knits
This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry  jacket  even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.,1,Dresses

This blouse is made out of a high-quality material  flows beautifully  and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference  size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.,1,Blouses

So often you find dresses in a cool  breathable material like rayon or silk  but the manufacturer lines it in hot  non-breathable polyester. which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day (or night). thankfully  someone at antropologie knows what they're doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon. thank you to that person.    yes  this dress is a bit on the short side. with it's modest neckline  it looks like it could be great for work  but it does hit a bit above the knee  so if you wo,1,Dresses

It's amazing!    i did size down on this one  but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area  but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem  but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my,1,Knits

Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now  spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically  there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust  and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus  the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all  a flattering better-than-basic sweater.,1,Knits

"I tried this on in the store  in regular size (i often need petite). i think on this one  i could go either way.  the cut is flattering fit and flare  and the colors are rich. i like the ""flowery"" design  good spring piece in my opinion  as it has components of all kinds of seasons: sleeveless and see-though material  buthe design part is almost like a fine corduroy  very soft. not too flimsy iether.",1,Dresses
"Oh my!! this dress is so cute! it fits me exactly like the pictures. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and ordered a medium. i maybe could have worn a small as well though. there is a lot of fabric to this dress  so if you're under 5'6""  it might overwhelm you! i'm 5'6"" and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel! this is s dress you can dress up or down. i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing. and pockets!! that was a nice surprise! the fabric is a little thicker  so it's no",1,Dresses
These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes  the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...,1,Pants
"One of the best tops i have ever bought! i love he material and the style. the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch. i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits! the shirt is true to size. i wear a size small and it fit perfectly (5'7""  145lbs  34b).",1,Knits

I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and don't show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,1,Knits
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.,1,Sweaters
Tried both colors....gorgeous  but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is.

Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky  which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.,1,Sweaters
This is such a pretty dress but it didn't do much for my figure.  i'm fairly long-waisted and the dress curved in around my lower rib-cage.  also  the beads were falling off everywhere.  i really wanted it to work but it is going back.,1,Dresses
I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off  but then i decided to try it on (the regualar) size in store to keep in mind for my next binge :-).  the cut is flattering  length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one. i would  as others have mentioend  wear it with a belt. overall it fits like a nice comfy t-shirt with comfy skirt  but as a dress  very nice.,1,Dresses
The perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top  the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death.,1,Knits
I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up  skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w,1,Blouses

The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing  you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.,1,Blouses
Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,1,Knits
The details on these capris are adorable - the stitching and side ribbon detail  the fit  weight of the fabric  everything is fantastic. i got the taupe and moss green because i couldn't decide. i wish they came in more colors. fit  for me  was true to size  i usually wear a 2 to a 4 (size 26 to 27 in denim) and got the 2 because i wanted them to be more fitted. they stretched a bit after wear  but not so much that they were too baggy. i will live in these  this summer. if you want a more fitted,1,Pants

Beautiful design and perfect for warm days. it has a lovely open back with the perfect amount of loose fitting flow.,1,Knits
So i really like this top. not my usual choice  but i'm trying to branch out. really like the top (i got the white one because they had it in my size). only thing is i could have sized down but arms/shoulders/bust are super tight so i went with the larger size. i got mine on sale and a button had already fallen off the back so forewarning that may be a problem in future....     but overall i really like this top.,1,Blouses
I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium  depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back  it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru  though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north  with tights and boots  you can too. so worth the price!,1,Dresses

I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing  lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage  and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it  but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.,1,Knits
Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,1,Shorts
I love these jeans  but they do stretch out! i was surprised at how loose they were right after washing/air drying the first time.,1,Jeans

It's impossible to tell  but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman  with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in  but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer  on both sides  which gives the dress movement  even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it,1,Dresses

I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue)  the fabric is comfortable  definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.,1,Blouses

The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted  so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.,1,Fine gauge

"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",1,Fine gauge
Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all  but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium  sometimes a small  but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!,1,Blouses

I see no one has reviewed this yet and since it is a beautiful sweater  and only available online  i thought i would contribute an opinion. the sweater is nicer in real life than the photo. it has a wonderful feel! the style: this sweater has very dramatic sleeves which i like though i could understand how that might annoy someone else. it is made with a heavy thick soft yarn so the sleeves hang nicely. i have worn it once and got complements so it is a sweater that while simple  is also a stand,1,Sweaters

I was nervous about this dress  as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they  they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress  perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.,1,Dresses

I got the red- it is a great color. this is one of those thin soft t shirts. it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down. the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department  but really not much- just have to line dry.,1,Knits

I went to retailerplpogie today to try this piece on and it was adorable. i really liked the lace part that lightly shows off the legs. this does run true to size. i am 5'5 and 116 pounds and wear a 34b and i was able to button up everything and be comfortable in a size 0. there is no stretch at all with the materials that they have used  so that might be an issue for some. the material was actually a bit thicker than what i would have thought for dress like this  but i really liked it overall and,1,Dresses

This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling  which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone),1,Dresses

Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy  polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening  with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down  it looks great with a denim jacket  then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short  sandals  pumps  you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone  loosely tied  or done in a bow. leggings or ti,1,Dresses
This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves  but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality  but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall  a very cute shirt!,1,Blouses
I just bought this today so i can't say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it's different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people won't have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.,1,Knits

I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.,1,Knits
I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty  flexible  and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!),1,Knits
"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual  chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",1,Pants

After promising myself never to buy another a-line skirt that makes me look shorter  i caved in because this one is so cute. the material is soft but holds its shape. you do have to have a long narrow waist line to pull this one off and size up one as i'm usually a 2  but took a 4 in this beauty. vintage perfection. pair with turtleneck or form fitting sweater or tee and clogs or heeled tall boots. it's a must!,1,Skirts

The photos do an amazing job of selling this coat. in person it is just a little bit less than what i was hoping for. the navy blue color is lovely and elegant and fits the sophisticated femininity of this style. black or khaki would be too boring.  the fabric is soft and drapes and flows beautifully  but it is quite thin. if you hold the coat up to the light you can almost see through it! the thinness probably helps the flattering fit of the coat  but i don't know how effective that makes it at,1,Outerwear

I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites  i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.     i'm 5'6  160 lbs  and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length  waist and bust fit perfectly.,1,Pants
I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium  so thought i'd be safe order the medium  which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper.,1,Knits

I love this peasant dress! i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy boots/frye jane boots  black tights and silver sparkly earrings -no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke. the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape  so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined  has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff  and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have,1,Dresses

The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress  you become drawn to it. then  as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery  and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny  set buttons  you soon realize  that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft  delicate  chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was,1,Dresses

I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest  the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy  flowy and pretty. i love it!,1,Knits
This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence  take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!,1,Dresses
"The quality of the fabric these are made from is wonderful- they are soft yet structured and i was so bummed they didn't fit me. i usually wear a size 28 in premium denim so i ordered a 28 and i could barely pull these up over my hips. once i pulled them on i was about 1-2 inches from being able to zip them closed. the pants fit in the legs but they were very close-fitting  which is not the look i'm going for. i am 5'5"" and was worried they would look too long since usually pants are for me  but",1,Jeans

Dressed up or dressed down  this summer dress is perfect. the skirt is a lot of fabric  like others have said  but it's part of what makes this dress fun; and because the top is fitted  i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted. that being said  the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable; at first it looked like a sack  but when it's on and adjusted it will l,1,Dresses
Very cute jumpsuit  especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3  115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!,1,Dresses
I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso  the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.,1,Knits

I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small  and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked.,1,Dresses

"I am 5'7""  approx. 135 lbs  27-28 in jeans  size 4 in dresses. purchased these in a size 8. i would suggest sizing up between one to two sizes. as a result  the upper thigh portion of the shorts do appear a little baggier - plus pleats - can be overwhelming in terms of material - but not so baggy that it would make it ""circus tent""-like. do not expect these to be fitted.definitely a fun pair of shorts. seems like it will go well with sandals  espadrilles  wedges. paired with either a front-tucke",1,Shorts
This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however  i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide  better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.  i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled! sadly returning.,1,Knits
Wow  i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank  i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy.   would totally buy different colors if it came in others  but i'm no,1,Blouses
I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on  yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually.     i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position.     the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!,1,Blouses

This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette  so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand  and,1,Jackets

I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,1,Knits

Love this top  looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short  so for me the high waist pants were a must  but if you don't mind showing your belly  then it would be cute with anything  the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.,1,Knits

I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit  especially online!      this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.       the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.,1,Swim
The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus  and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.  the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.  i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.,1,Blouses

The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in.  like another reviewer said  the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress.,1,Dresses
I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good  not too right or lose. i took a size medium  which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me  also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.,1,Knits

Loved the colors (greenish  coal and white) and shirt texture but the fit was horrible. i sized up to an xl because you can never tell sizing with this line. that didn't help. it fit  although a bit long but the deal breaker was that i looked huge from the side view. since i carry my weight in my mid section  high/low cuts on the side are tricky on my frame. it fit well in the bust over my 34g's and looked nice from the front. i do recommend it. if you have my body issues you might pass.,1,Knits

Overall  very nice pair of boyfriend style jeans. super comfy. i asked one of the in store stylist for help styling them- she was very helpful and showed me lots of possibilities for these pants. also good for a post-partum tummy :),1,Jeans
I saw this in the store  not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.,1,Fine gauge
This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!,1,Jeans
This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.,1,Layering
"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up  but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable  warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size  i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!",1,Dresses
I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit  i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.,1,Lounge
Ordered a size 0  my usual at retailer... very flattering  fits well,1,Dresses
I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!,1,Dresses
These are a soft and lightweight material. the photos here don't show the tiny beautiful pattern on them. look closely through the photos and you'll see it. way better than a normal pair of black summer pants. these are very log so i plan to hem to flats to wear for a more casual look but they have the ability to go either way. the pockets flare out a big so i'm going to have those sewn shut when i do the hemming. it is a higher west so great for that look or to wear with some cropped style summ,1,Pants
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back  36c (34d)  short waist  and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought  so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front  but not as a high/low top would be. rather  it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater  and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2""  and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",1,Knits
I really like the soft  flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs  the s was too large  so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets  elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides  slip underneath  and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.,1,Dresses
Wanted to buy this dress  but the bust area was way too small. as i went up sizes  the torso began to be too long  and i would have to have it altered  i guess. what a shame.  but  if you are small chested  then this is your dress.,1,Dresses
This top is one of my favorites  i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer  and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me  i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.,1,Blouses
More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past  they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made  lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid,1,Dresses
The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important  these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.,1,Swim
This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!,1,Fine gauge
Quality is great  fits very well at waste  i am 5'4 135lb bought size 8p and it's good... i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor. they are more fall/spring/winter pants as material quite thick. overall  i am happy with them,1,Pants
"I'm 5'3"" with high waist and some booty. this dress has a fantastic  flattering fit. i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model. (love the belt too  btw).  the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath. i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals. looking for a suede jacket now...",1,Dresses
I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.,1,Dresses
This is my third top from this designer  and normally i wear a small  but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me. i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost  but the sapphire is wonderful. works great with slacks or more casual clothes. i liked the sleeve length as well. i'm not too busty  but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem.,1,Knits
"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",1,Blouses
"Omg! so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all! i wish the blue print was still available in my size. tried them on at the store and fell in love! they say the length is 31.5  however i am on the tall side  usually wear 34"" in jeans  but these are perfect. i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while. please don't change them  and i will be getting another pair or two next year!!!",1,Jeans
This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me  and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.,1,Dresses
I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute  comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm  are incredibly soft  and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!,1,Intimates
This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.,1,Intimates
"This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5""  127 pounds and a 30f chest  you never know how a top will fit. however  this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!",1,Blouses
I love this dress.   i believe the picture on-line doesn't show the unique pattern and design.   it does have an interesting design.    add a long vest  statement necklace  and boots - you will be quite fashionable.,1,Dresses
I'd been eyeing this dress for a while  wondering if it could work for me. i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale. its pretty perfect-i am 5'4' and currently 130 lbs. it fits well  if a touch loose in the waist  but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust  as it's fairly fitted there. the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear  which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular (that and the length)  but i can,1,Dresses
"This dress is quite lovely in person  but it runs very small  particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium)  but i had a hard time getting into this  and the top was literally about 10"" from being able to zip up. granted  i have a larger than average bust  but that's still excessive  and the fabric has no give whatsoever.  the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s",1,Dresses
Wow  i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.,1,Skirts
This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches  it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style  not trendy so it wi,1,Dresses
"Best ""jeggings"" ever! they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings. soft but substantial fabric  nice dark gray  worn in color.",1,Jeans
Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,1,Skirts
This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l  sometimes xl in tops from retailer  but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top  and now that it's on sale  the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!,1,Knits
I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore  it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.,1,Dresses
I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.,1,Knits

I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall  so i bought it a size smaller than normal  but it fits  so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy  and it kind of camouflaged that  which is always great!,1,Dresses
This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.,1,Blouses
I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!,1,Dresses

Dress runs a little small  tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft  flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.,1,Dresses
I feel like this top is almost perfect  but there's something missing. the details are nice  the fit is fine  but something wasn't right. maybe it was the weird arm length?    fits tts  if a tad on the large side.,1,Knits

This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up  i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however  the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice  additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves.       i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n,1,Dresses
This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however  i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.,1,Blouses
This blazer is really well made  it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size  i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!,1,Jackets

I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well  more so in dresses than tops. also  it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity  but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also  the length is nice  close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr,1,Dresses
This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.    i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package  there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that  but i usually don't find belts in my size.    as for the fit  it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!,1,Dresses

I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes  it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.,1,Blouses

Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,1,Sweaters

This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.,1,Jeans

I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top  but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves  but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick  which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up  but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.,1,Knits

This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit  but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through  and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette,1,Swim
I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture  it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters)  so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0  but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie  it can be cinched in to create,1,Blouses

I caught this on sale and bought the light pink version. it is very lightweight and delicate. i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape / design- but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy. it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekend. the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater- it does feel more,1,Fine gauge

This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much  online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle  especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person  which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me  it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy,1,Dresses

I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result  the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.,1,Trend

I tried this shirt and really loved the feel  and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery  and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me  but i'm between m&l  and sized down  so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!,1,Knits
This dress is very  very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long  coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there  it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!,1,Dresses

These are a different take on the white jean. thick enough that you don't see undies. cool lace detail on the ankles. i have very long legs  so they hit me a little higher than described. i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom. i love the fit of the plico jean. i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesn't peek out. i usually wear a 27  and they aren't too tight and have a bit of stretch  but don't loose their s,1,Jeans
Colors are much brighter in person  fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey  so still considering whether to keep it.,1,Fine gauge

This is the second tulle skirt by bailey 44 that i have bought. the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent. i am normally a size 6 and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine. it is a pull-on skirt but the waistband doesn't have a lot of stretch to it.,1,Skirts

I'm an xl in retailer tops  and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back  and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down.   -  i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model  but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck,1,Blouses

I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering  but then i'm not very busty  so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only  but well worth it for such a unique  pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.,1,Blouses
I love this! it is comfortable  flowing and reminds me of glamorous women in 1970's movies. i especially love that is completely looks like a shirt (its pants) because i don't have to worry about my skirt flying up as i race around the city. bra// no bra doesn't matter  which i love. as someone with a larger bottom then top and am pretty tall  i usually have trouble finding one piece items that aren't too short in the crotch/waist zone. very roomy without looking like a sack.,1,Dresses
I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out  giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit  and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.,1,Knits

Ordered this on a whim  in my normal size large  and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft  fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.,1,Blouses
These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down  and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.,1,Legwear
"The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through  but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between ""true to size"" and ""runs large "" i.e.  leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me)  but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4""  120 lbs.  athletic build  and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa",1,Knits
I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .     one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you  these are not the pants,1,Pants

Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist  but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).     it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.,1,Jackets

The fabric of these pants isn't like regular denim  rather it's soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans  however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!,1,Jeans

I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but  once i washed it (in cold in my machine  reshaped and air-dried)  it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.,1,Blouses

This suit is really flattering and comfortable. i love the pattern and the removable strap. the only downside is the top of the suit folds down easily showing the lining at the top. this has been the case with other suits i've bought from retailer  but it's so flattering that i can live with that flaw.,1,Swim

I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though  i thought it flattering enough to keep.,1,Knits
I really love this dress  just not on me! i am very curvy  with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8  160lbs)  and the 10 fit  but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach  i would have kept it  but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great  the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend  who is picky ,1,Dresses

This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress. it's really comfortable  true to size and the cut is flattering. you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals. i didn't want to take it off. sizing is straightforward on this one: just order your regular size. there's nothing tricky about sizing. the xxsp (my regular size  depicted here)  was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description. great buy. waiting for boston weather to coope,1,Dresses
I purchased this dress for a summer celebration. i am petite  but ordered the dress in a misses size (one size smaller) because i wanted it to hit right at the knee  rather than the shorter above-the-knee length pictured. i loved all about the dress - the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip.. i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone. i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles.,1,Dresses

This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews  however  it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6  but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .,1,Blouses
I agree with the previous review that this skirt definitely runs small. i am normally a size 4 with rooms but this size 4 was very tight. i decided not to go through the trouble of exchanging and to keep it. my boyfriend seems to like the style more than i do so that's a good thing :),1,Skirts

Flattering even for a 50+ year old body. the lavender is subtle and pretty (it's a blue-ish color) and the sweater skims the body nicely. i have a broad back and some delicate sweaters make me look unwieldy; this one is minimizing. sleeves are long  but not too much so. i usually wear an 8 and the m fits well.,1,Fine gauge
Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful  the embroidery is gorgeous  i feel so feminine in this coat,1,Sweaters

I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much  but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas  it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.,1,Blouses

This is such a classy  elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color  but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.,1,Fine gauge

These jeans! i tried these on  in addition to the high rise paige denim  and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother  with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs  but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a,1,Jeans
Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green  so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes  the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6  and this one the 8 fit perfectly  so maybe one size up.,1,Dresses
"I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.  i ordered all 3 colors  and they just arrived........love love love !!!  they are soft  comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.  the understated ruffled details add the special ""something"" that is so retailer.  they are sophisticated yet pretty.  the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.  the plum/purple is a rich  unique and pretty color.  the navy is a perfect ""denim"" color.  a fantastic basic",1,Knits
Usually a m  ordered a s and sp. the sp fit well. comfortable/flattering. fit note: picture makes it look like nude lining is a lot shorter  it is not - this was true in both sizes. great holiday/nye party dress. i disagree fabric feels cheap  but hem off pattern/not even. worth it on sale but not full price.,1,Dresses

Love these pilcro jeans  my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs  they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist  not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!,1,Jeans

I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel  this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes  i would order down.,1,Blouses

I am on the fence on this one........it's quite beautiful as color goes  the pic online seems rather faded. i just felt it was a bit wider on the bottom than might be flattering otherwise. beautifully made and the fabric is of great quality.   i just i wish some of these tops were in better proportion from top to bottom  and less bulky.  other than that i still may purchase as the print is beautiful..........,1,Blouses
Adore the rust color in this top. very pretty rust color. would go with a lot of stuff. my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye. i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath. but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect  drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix. beautiful on. felt that it fit tts. i'm usually a 34b  got an xs in this top.,1,Knits
I saw this sweater online and had to try it. i went to my local retailer to try it on and i'm glad i did. i am usually a xs - s in tops and i thought this fit best in a medium. it's very chunky which is what i was looking for and so soft - not scratchy at all. it has wide bell sleeves  but that's very on trend right now. i am 5'4  34b and it falls about an inch below the top of my jeans. it's not form fitting but so snugly. i plan on wearing it with dark denim skinnies  booties  and simple jewlery,1,Sweaters

This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!,1,Blouses
But the back of it  by the waist  bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger  it will be too long. but i love the skirt  it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured  just below the knee in front. the waist is snug  bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier.

"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels  as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so  it doesn't swallow me",1,Fine gauge

I ordered a size large and it's so big i couldn't tell how it would look in a smaller size. the waist cinched but there's too much fabric in the hips to be slimming. the floral pattern is beautiful with light blue and lavender flowers that are generic enough to match with a variety of colors on top. it's too long for my frame. the slip falls above knee so it's sheer from there down. i decided not to try a smaller size but recommend going down one or even two sizes.,1,Skirts

The concept of this sweater is really pretty. my usual size xl fit perfectly; not tight or too loose. the color of the sweater is not like the photo; there is a lot more of a brown tone. by putting the sweater on and taking it off i must have torn a hole because there is a 1 1/2 inch tear in the front where the peplum bottom panel has been felted to the body of the sweater. it literally pulled apart where the two fabrics meet. the other issue i have with the sweater is the area where the front a,1,Fine gauge

This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie  the lace on the sides  the hem  the sleeves  the pleats at the chest  and the liner is opaque so it's not see-through. but it's very white  baby doll cut  and very short. in order to avoid the maternity  wedding-ish look  a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up  a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size 2 regular  and it still falls about 3 inches above m,1,Dresses

I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,1,Knits

I normally wear a size 27  but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite  but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle  but i have very skinny calves and ankles  so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.,1,Jeans

"I got the small petite and this fits beautifully  as on the model (i am 5'2""). i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one! it would certainly hide any belly  but the drape works best if you're streamlined  i imagine. if you've got a tapering torso  go for it! depending on your bust  you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra. not that i've found it a problem.",1,Knits

The print of this dress is what enticed me  and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however  the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined  but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days  but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well.   the dress is more a-line than pictured  which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare,1,Lounge

I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there  but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves  and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low  but offered full coverage on my 34a bust  but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice  and it's a prett,1,Blouses

I do not think this dress runs large. i think it it is true to size. i am usually a size 10 and a 34dd. definitely curvy and tall at 5'8. the large was perfect for my bust. i ordered a med also  and it looks really narrow in the waist. length is below knees as pictured. i was finding that the zipper under left arm is very catchy. i even checked the med and it is worse. that concerns me  but love the dress so i am keeping the large. length is so hard. i hardly ever find a dress the hits a little,1,Dresses

This dress is light  airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan.   this dress is a keeper!,1,Dresses
I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality  the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down  i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b,1,Outerwear

Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans  the script  and hyphen to name a few  absolutely love them  they fit tts  super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look  super soft  with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately  i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer  andddddd  they are no longer made in the usa  but in china....so you may need to try on,1,Jeans

I feel in love when i tried it on! i'm 5'2 an usually have to hem long dresses - but this on fits perfectly. it's full length on me -it's shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length. and it's a gorgeous burgundy. soft and comfortable. can't wait to wear it!,1,Dresses

Gorgeous and soft  luxurious feeling sweater! i purchased this in the pink/purple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it. it's unbelievably soft  feels like a blanket. i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little  it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulder....as it's very cold where i am...can't see wearing it that far off during the winter! that was my solution and i love it! i'm typically and xs  bought the xxs b/c it appeared,1,Sweaters
As others mentioned  you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back  and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering  and classy. i can wear this to work  or out  just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest  and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously  beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!),1,Dresses

Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it  of course  was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.  that said  i love the suit and am going to try in one and 2 siz,1,Swim
The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics  but in person i found it femine  pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky  colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy  gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.,1,Dresses

This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.,1,Dresses

I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy  but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress  yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through  however  for a texas summer  that defeats the point of a loose  easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.,1,Dresses

The high/low hem is interesting  and the fit looks great. i did find that i needed one size larger than normal.  maybe that's bc these are high rise?  there is also absolutely no stretch in the fabric.,1,Jeans
I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,1,Skirts

Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,1,Dresses

It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes  it runs big and wide but not long  which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer  but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top  easy breathing for humidity.   i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap  so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh,1,Knits

This suit is so beautiful  and the quality is great. i wanted it to work out  but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit. i am a 36c and there is zero support (which i assumed when i ordered it  but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try). for those who have a smaller bust  or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile  this may be perfect. i ordered the large  and the bottoms were a good fit. i am also very petite and the length was good one,1,Swim

I think this top looks lovely; however  it does not fit my body shape. i am an hourglass shape. the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didn't drape nicely around my waist/hips like on the model. i think top could look great on someone who has a lean  square  or athletic build.    also  this top definitely runs large. according to the retailer size chart  i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements  but this top was much too large overall in a small and still,1,Knits

I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer  but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.,1,Dresses
I just love this dress! the color  the quality  the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews  and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top  so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into.,1,Dresses

"This top is so cute  but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in  but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.",1,Blouses

I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry  and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust  due to the ribbing  but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me  like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.,1,Knits
What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,1,Fine gauge

These pants overall are very comfortable  but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short  and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter  so if you have long legs or like more draping  you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh  a bit puffy  i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality  and cute design.,1,Lounge
I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.   other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.,1,Blouses
Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer  and i quickly make the purchase without any regret.  without being stuffy or old  this top is simply elegant. the floral is very high-end designer (think italian made) for a fraction of the cost. made of 100% bamboo  it is light without being sheer. there is no need for a cami with this one. the fabric has the body of a good linen  but it doesn't wrinkle nearly as much. it does require dry cleaning  though  if this matters to you.,1,Blouses

Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual  asymmetrical seam that appears along the front  right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest  and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl  and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun,1,Knits

This is way shinier in person than i expected  but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted  but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content  but that's it.,1,Knits

This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small)  though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall  it is really very flowing and lovely on  with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.,1,Dresses
I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also  the sleeves are a bit long  but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!,1,Fine gauge

I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it  it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy,1,Dresses
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.,1,Dresses
I love love love these bright red jeans. they fit great  they're super soft and comfortable  and the bright red is a great punch of color. only sad about how expensive they are. at that price point  i decided to return them  but am hoping they get marked down!,1,Jeans
"I love these! they are cute enough to wear out  and they are really comfortable. i ordered a small and at 5'3"" they are a little long but they shrunk in the wash and they're still totally wearable",1,Lounge
"Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4""  138#.  even at my age it looks great.",1,Blouses
"I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this! pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect. i'm 5'6""  127 lbs  34b. love this--definitely unique and feminine. and--no--nary a smell in the mix!",1,Knits
Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.,1,Blouses
I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures  i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy  but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n,1,Sweaters
"Coh emerson style jeans are the best fit and style. the ""pacifica"" color is a light blue and nice for spring and summer. i love the slim boyfriend. i have thighs and they fit like a skinny without being super tight. there is just enough stretch. no holes either. they are easy to dress up or down and have become my new favorites.",1,Jeans
Super cute and flattering!,1,Dresses
Not as pink as pictured online  definitely more of a pale peach. fits loose  so i'm glad i went with my normal size  or would seem boxy. cute top  and will wear it around town running errands..instead of my activewear!,1,Knits
The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a,1,Skirts
"I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a ""short"" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so  it's not as ""loose"" on the inside as you would think. this ""short"" is not a bad thing...but  it's something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon...",1,Pants
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!,1,Pants
I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite,1,Dresses
I think i will really love this skirt. it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it. it does have a bit of a weird  long drop waist  but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering. i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons. i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon. i am happy with my purchase.,1,Skirts
I liked this bc it is long  ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.,1,Fine gauge
The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.,1,Intimates
Did not even know this is available in petite! as someone who is at 5' exaggerated  there regular size xs/s fits nicely. great find. goes well with leggings or jeans. this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while.,1,Sweaters
I saw this dress in the store window and had to try it on and it is perfect! it's lined  got pockets  can wash at home  and is a work appropriate length. it's cold in the northeast right now  so i'm wearing it with tights boots and a cardi. i really like that it isn't fitted  but is form flattering. overall win!,1,Dresses
Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online  but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.,1,Knits
I wasn't looking for a little black dress but i couldn't resist this one. it's as stunning in person as it is in the pictures online. the front has a corset-like closure which i didn't realize until it arrived. it's very classy though  not cheap looking. the lace detail is really beautiful. i was a bit concerned about how the sheer looking areas would look because i was hoping to wear the dress for a dressy work function. it's definitely a sexy dress but the fact that there's so much coverage ma,1,Dresses
I love this top. it has a relaxed fit without being frumpy  and it looks great with boyfriend jeans or skinny jeans and boots. it's a great  soft fabric that doesn't require a cami underneath. wish there were other colors.,1,Knits
