I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.,0,Dresses
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!,0,Pants
This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.  other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.,0,Dresses
Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,1,Blouses
Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.,0,Dresses

I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering  i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open  as pictured  tied one button  and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.    i debated getting my usual xs petite  but hey  they don't make it in petite  and the stylist thought the loo,1,Jackets
"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer  but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice  flattering drape. i'm 5'3""  110lbs.  32c  petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",1,Blouses
These are the best leggings i've ever worn. because they are structured and substantial  they are less casual than ordinary leggings. i bought them for a trip to paris  and i wore them many times. they're sleek  stylish  comfortable  and they go with everything!,1,Pants
I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look  size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos). ---------- overall these are very nice. but there is one is,0,Knits
I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!,0,Knits
The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,0,Dresses
I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.,0,Blouses
Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,0,Dresses
"When i first saw this in the retailer catalog  i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints  and unique color combinations  both of which this top has. i'm 5'3""  120 lbs and a small bust at 32b  i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality  i definitely recommend it if your shape is s",1,Blouses
I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said  the sleeves are a tighter fit  but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low  so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.,1,Knits
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.,0,Sweaters
This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'4 and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.,1,Dresses
The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse  and great quality.,0,Blouses
Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out  and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah,0,Lounge
I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.,1,Jeans
I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.,0,Knits
The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.,0,Knits
"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty",1,Dresses

Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly.,1,Pants
These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes  the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...,1,Pants
I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!,0,Knits
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,0,Knits
Love this! perfect in the summer with bright  strappy heels or sandals or booties in the winter.,1,Pants
I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.,0,Skirts
I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft  hangs well  and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in  i'm very comfortable in this dress  but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.,1,Dresses
"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me  even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model  maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g",1,Pants

"For reference i am 5'5"" and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design. the skirt fit perfectly  but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt. the quality is great but the design and color is not. the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture  more like a dark red wine. it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric",0,Skirts
Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.,0,Dresses

I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,1,Dresses

"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",0,Shorts
I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton  making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6  i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area  making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a,0,Dresses

This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side  not the front. very unflattering on me.,0,Dresses
I thought this top was so pretty and airy  but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.,0,Knits
This top is very cute  but i found it runs small in the bust  which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up  if you have a generous bust.,0,Blouses
Gorgeous piece  although much longer than it appears to be in the photo. the price  however  is a bit steep. i'm not sure that i'm going to keep it because i just don't think it looks as expensive as it is.,1,Dresses
I purchased this shirt in a medium  in the wine color. i love the drape and fit of the shirt. it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy. it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts i've bought at retailer. you could easily dress this up or down. i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat. it majorly shrunk! now i can't wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more. if you purc,0,Knits

This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,1,Swim

My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online  so that was nice to see consistency. overall though  i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks  which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short  and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving  walking or dancing in this dress  which brings me to the question of,0,Dresses
I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.,0,Dresses

I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,0,Jeans
I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi,0,Jackets
I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side  across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser  i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.,0,Dresses
"1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.  2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size.  3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.",0,Skirts

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend
I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,1,Shorts

I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs  2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down  even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings.,0,Dresses
This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,1,Sweaters

The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,0,Dresses
I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.,0,Blouses

This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy  feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully  i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it's a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful,1,Fine gauge

Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,0,Skirts

This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r,0,Dresses

Surprisingly flattering on  especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust  the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way)  the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office  under a jacket  or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not,1,Blouses

I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses

This is a great tee. true to size  i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.,1,Knits

Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0,Knits

So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater  but so light that you can wear it for summer.,1,Knits

I was nervous about this dress  as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they  they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress  perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.,1,Dresses

It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,0,Jackets
Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.,0,Sweaters
Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however  after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater  but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.,0,Sweaters
I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,0,Jackets
Pretty shirt on the hanger  but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering  and i'm just a 34 b.,0,Knits

I agree with the other reviewer  the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.,1,Jackets

I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.,0,Blouses

This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i,0,Jackets

This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on,0,Knits

I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry  and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust  due to the ribbing  but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me  like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.,1,Knits

Lightweight and casual  i picked this jacket up on sale. i usually don't like sale items aggressively priced- there is usually a reason why it was a difficult sell to begin with  but this was a pleasant surprise- as in no surprise! picture depicts color and material well. great throw-on for running errands. clean lines  nice simple detail. only thing that is slightly annoying is that the off-center zipper makes the wider side flap over when not zipped  but this is true with almost any top cut th,1,Jackets
Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,0,Skirts
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.,0,Dresses

I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale  too. thoughts below:  ______  pros:  - it is well made and on the thicker side.   - for a peplum  it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips  which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo,1,Blouses
I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.,0,Knits
There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,0,Blouses
This is the perfect tank. it's super soft  great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all  it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!,1,Lounge
I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.,0,Dresses
The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased  but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute  but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.,1,Blouses

Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!,0,Dresses

This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,1,Lounge

The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,0,Knits

I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times  hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.,0,Blouses

I was excited to see this top in person  but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first  the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it.     second  the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been,0,Blouses

This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy  loose-fitting tops  but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.,0,Blouses

This is such a great dress  i hate to return it. it's pretty  a nice material  and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said  it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs  or if it came in petite  i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not  it has to go back.,0,Dresses

"I didn't know what to put for ""runs small  true to size  or runs large "" but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl  and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time  i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large  based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad  for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you  go for",0,Knits
Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide  long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled  adding i,1,Jackets
I love the colors and pattern on this dress  and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however  i'm pretty small up top  and the neckline comes pretty low  so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra  or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet  but will keep the dress for sure.,1,Dresses

I so wanted to love this dress  despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.,0,Dresses
I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c,0,Lounge
Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.,0,Blouses

I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.,0,Lounge

Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants
The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead  there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting  though  and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section  just the mid section  then tapers in at,0,Knits

Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.,0,Dresses
This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0,Dresses

I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller  it would work for you.,0,Knits
Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess.,0,Blouses

I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.,0,Blouses

I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded  worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!  the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build  small bust. true to size.,1,Blouses
I have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it. it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up. super versatile!!,1,Knits

"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",0,Layering
The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.,0,Swim
It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0,Blouses

I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.,0,Dresses
I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,1,Blouses

I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice  but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl  but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.,1,Swim
I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.,1,Jeans
I love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn't seem to have helped.,0,Jeans
Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately  for a well endowed woman like myself  it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(,0,Dresses
The shirt is nice  but not as nice a material as i was hoping  but i kept it anyway. but after washing it  it is even more disappointing  not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me  but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.,0,Knits
I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other,0,Pants
I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut  but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.,0,Blouses
"I love this little number. the quality is terrific  the weight is perfect  and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy  without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one  but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?",1,Knits
These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest  but at the same time  are not too busy. they seem well-made  and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.,1,Pants

With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha,0,Dresses
I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist  but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.,1,Dresses
These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink  rolled in a towel  and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well  these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!,1,Pants
I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store - the details are beautiful - beading  embroidery  and small opening details on the arms. from a practicality standpoint  it has pockets  it's machine washable  and it can easily be worn as is  with black leggings or tall boots in fall  and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter. for sizing  i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely  but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way. if i had sized down the shoulder seam,1,Dresses
Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.,0,Legwear
I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt,0,Skirts
I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing  lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage  and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it  but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.,1,Knits

"I noticed the reddish one (actually  barney-purple) in my local store and had to try it one  since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years. the color was my main concern  but this proved perfect overall. it is low cut in the bust  but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls. there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off. for the reference  i am 5'4""  120 lbs  and an xs was perfect.",1,Dresses
I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0,Pants

This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit  as described by other reviewers  is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me  i guess  so this one is going home to retailer...,0,Dresses

Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!,0,Dresses

The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping,0,Knits

"I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great. the dress is forgiving if you're trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesn't go all the way around. it's just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesn't look like just a sack. if you have a great waistline  you may not like this! i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights  it looked fine.
