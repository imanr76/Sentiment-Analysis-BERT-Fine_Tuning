I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days  however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl,0,Knits
Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired.,0,Outerwear
This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.,0,Knits
I bought this at the store today and it's the perfect summer top! i'm not going to pull it off my shoulders  so it's a little shorter than shown here. but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy. it will go with so many things! very well made  thickish material.,1,Blouses
I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however  the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.,0,Dresses
I love this shirt! great fabric  nice quality  flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy  and the white is actually oatmeal.,1,Knits
Very soft material  probably will pill quickly but it is super comfortable. it is also very low cut; it works perfectly for me for breastfeeding because each of the front panels can be easily pulled to the side. a cami underneath is required  the model definitely isn't wearing a bra. i'll be wearing a nursing tank under this. definitely a good print for summer.,1,Knits
Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.,1,Knits
This shirt fits great. normally wear an xs or a small and a small fits in this. comfortable and cute on. i wish i had ordered the other color as well.,1,Knits
This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,0,Dresses
Bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you.,0,Swim
Based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.,0,Dresses
This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t,0,Dresses
Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s,0,Blouses
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect!   i ordered a size 2 petite  which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.",1,Dresses
"Online this dress caught my eye but the reviews seemed to indicate there was something weird with the length so i did not want to order it online and have to send it back etc...because i am 5'5"" and did not know weather to get the petite or the regular! my local store had it and i bought a regular small and it is not too long. it comes just to the ground in the back like any other maxi. it is super comfortable and gorgeous! i am not sure where i am going in it yet....but it was just too pretty o",1,Dresses
This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!,0,Dresses
I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right  it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point  but with the 25% of full p,1,Dresses
3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,0,Intimates
"The photos don't look it  but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.     disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",0,Sweaters
This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy  not black. very dark navy  yes. still  not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top  and i can wear it right now.,1,Knits
I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.,0,Skirts
I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.,0,Jeans
I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :),1,Lounge
Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!,1,Dresses
Very flattering cut. only con is that is seems to snag easily. extremely comfortable and don;t need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would.,1,Lounge
"Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3"" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer.",1,Fine gauge
"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite  but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated  and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem  not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely  but i just can't",0,Dresses
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.,0,Knits
Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra  you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt  as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out  it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!,1,Dresses
This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.,0,Dresses
Cute skirt and print  but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture  but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.,1,Skirts
I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty  really perfect color for fall. i like that it's not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it's difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it's not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it's all polyester  which is just cheap fabric. if it wasn't for that  i'd give it 5 stars.,1,Dresses
I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge ,0,Swim
The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.,0,Swim
This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,0,Pants

"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket  but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but  i live in california  so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it",1,Trend

"The dress at first glance is pretty  feminine  and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me  all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap  hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting  already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return",0,Dresses

"I purchased a large and it fit perfect. i'm a size 12- 36dd. the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves. thick enough that it doesn't need a slip and will stretch to fit size 14 ladies  maybe size 16 too. i'm 5'7"" and the length is great on me with flat sandals. doesn't show my bra either.",1,Dresses
I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist,0,Dresses

This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can,0,Knits
I bought this top in the gray color and my usual size large.   the fit is perfect.  i don't have the tight neck issue that another reviewer had.  there is an odd knitted neck that you can't see on the model since her hair covers it.  i love the softness  fit  and embroidery of the top  but was debating on returning because of that weird  stiff neck knitting.  my husband said that he really liked it  so i gave it a shot.  i'm wearing it right now and it's super comfortable. i don't notice the nec,1,Knits
The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it  but when i turn to the side  you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end  not the most flattering.,0,Dresses
I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also  perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts,1,Fine gauge

The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.,0,Knits
I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.,0,Dresses
This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.,0,Knits
The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly  the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.,0,Dresses
Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure  and this just made me look like i was pregnant.,0,Knits

I was excited to receive this top because i love the design  but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.,0,Knits

This is a cute dress  but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it  i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered  i assumed it was red and black checked  but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors  so it is going back.,1,Dresses

I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!,0,Blouses
I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of,0,Lounge

I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it.  they were talking about how cute it was (they didn't have it in the store).  i asked what size it was and it was a medium  so i said i want to try it on.  after trying it on  i fell in love  it is so cute  the cut fit great.  it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust.  if you are in between sizes  you can probably size down.  i wore it yest,1,Blouses
This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops  but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!,1,Blouses
While overall it's a pretty top  there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it  the top would be wide  longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown  the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some  as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off  and sewn  making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off  and the sleeve length is long with elastic,1,Blouses

I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo,0,Blouses
"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",0,Outerwear

When you order online  you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers  i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral  cream  green  and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however  i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes  order down.,1,Blouses

I was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.,0,Trend
This blouse is beautiful  and very versatile  as others have said. i seem to have been buying many maeve prints lately  and got used to that fit. this blouse fits slimmer  but not tight  and ends up extremely flattering. the arms are also a bit slimmer in cut but not too tight -- the fabric has a little give/stretch and so even f they aren't totally loose  it's still comfortable. the lace detail is subtle but pretty. i am going to wear this to death  i can tell.,1,Knits

I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available  so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white  like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress  but t,1,Dresses

Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale  and while it was cute on  i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there,1,Dresses

I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,0,Knits

My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this  but i thought it was cute and springy.    i tried on a large first  since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders. (i'm tall  big boned and 175 pounds) the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didn't do much for my shape.    the medium  however was great! it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldn't,1,Knits
"This dress in orange is lovely. it's very light weight which i was slightly disappointed by  i prefer heavier dresses. but it'll be good for spring and summer. it still seems to be constructed well. i'm 5'8"" and 170 and the 8 i purchased is a little too tight. so i'm thinking it may run a little smaller than some other dress brands i have from retailer. 8 is usually my go to size. a 10 would have probably been perfect.",1,Dresses

So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :),1,Dresses

I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but,0,Pants

This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.,0,Knits

I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!,1,Pants
This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work  so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.,0,Blouses

I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c  127#. the moment i put it on  it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit  and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.,0,Sweaters

I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.,1,Dresses
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,1,Sweaters
The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,0,Fine gauge
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design,0,Knits
This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments  it is lined  highly recommend.,1,Dresses
I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me  returned it.,0,Sweaters

I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean  i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress  just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.,0,Lounge

This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this.  the material is very nice  soft and stretchy.,0,Dresses
"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner",1,Swim
Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....,0,Knits
I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd)  which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless  i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.,1,Blouses
This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there  however  it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types  but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling  comfortable top however.,0,Knits

I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0,Sleep
These corduroys are comfortable and fit true to size. (i am just over 5 feet tall  106 lbs  with long legs for my height  and the 25 fits really well.) they wash and dry well  with minimal (if any) shrinkage  as long as you use low temperatures. i gave them 4 stars  instead of 5  because i feel the material could be more substantial than it is. the green is actually a very attractive mossy brown.,1,Jeans

Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,1,Lounge

Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.,0,Knits
This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!,0,Dresses
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.,0,Dresses

I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on,0,Knits
True to form  this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight  stylish  great for a shorter person like myself  and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long  but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater  too  but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one ,1,Knits

Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams  but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect  however  the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.  dress looks exactly as in the picture.,0,Dresses

I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.,0,Dresses

I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was  however  pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side  noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much,1,Blouses

This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer  but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy  so if you're looking for something more fitted  this might not be for you.,1,Blouses
The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i wouldn't have given this dress a thought based on the online pics  but in person i found it femine  pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it isn't too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky  colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy  gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress wouldn't be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.,1,Dresses

I ordered this in a size s  my usual size and it fits great. i love the color  style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of  ever so slightly  poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color  i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!,1,Dresses

My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr,0,Trend

I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.,0,Sweaters
Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.,1,Blouses

Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.,0,Pants
I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.,0,Dresses

Love the cotton knit  for the comfort  but from a distance this blouse looks dressier. the embroidery adds a nice flare. personally  i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom  as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants. i found that it ran a little bit  but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway.,1,Knits

"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",0,Shorts

I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,0,Jackets

So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight  the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue)  the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately  i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g)  so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular  which hopefully will have a little more room  but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this dress  and i don't. it is soft  it is flattering on the model  and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back  causing the drape along the bottom to look odd  and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband  but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again  very often.,1,Lounge

Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,0,Pants

Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on,0,Blouses

This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however  it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side  but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale  so i am keeping it.,1,Swim

The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.,0,Sweaters
I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept  just didn't work for me.,0,Blouses
Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!,0,Dresses
A sales associate suggested this top and i'm glad she did. it's easy to miss at first!  -------------------  pros:  - beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.  - double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.  - lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.  - roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.  - great fabric. forgiving fit.  - can be dressed up or down.  - lengt,1,Blouses

I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great  but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.,1,Dresses

Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well  i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(,0,Dresses
This definitely works for you - think fabric  great quality  and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant  cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.,1,Blouses
I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.,0,Knits
I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.,0,Knits

I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba,0,Outerwear
I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!,0,Dresses

I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.,0,Dresses

I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.,0,Jeans
"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.",0,Blouses
I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,0,Sweaters
It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it,0,Knits
I caught this on sale and bought the light pink version. it is very lightweight and delicate. i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape / design- but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy. it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekend. the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater- it does feel more,1,Fine gauge

So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.,0,Pants

I bought this in store without trying it on. bought my typical size xs. the armholes are cut very low  as is the front neckline. it has an overall slightly slouchy fit. i definitely could not wear this to work without a camisole underneath. otherwise  i really like the style  and the black and white striped color way will go with alot.,1,Knits
This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim  & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms  and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light  but i love in so cal  so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies  heeled clogs  and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4  140lb  34b  and the 8 fits perfectly.,1,Dresses
This is a nice dress  but i'm glad i tried it on in the store. not for women with bigger breasts. i'm 36d and size 10 didn't fit me on top. lace part was too short to cover the whole area. other than that color is great .,0,Dresses
The print and style we're great! unfortunately  my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this  even if i sized up.,0,Dresses
Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement,0,Sweaters
A little more see-through than you would think  but has super cute smaller details! also needs to be ironed  a lot.,1,Blouses
This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.,1,Dresses
Very well made dress but runs extremely small! definitely size up!,1,Dresses
The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,0,Jackets
This dress fits awfully. it's not short  as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've  also  felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it  potentially  may look okay on someone who is very tall  skinny  and lanky  but i have my doubts about that too.,0,Dresses
It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.,0,Dresses
I practically live in lounge pants  and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well  if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband  and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown  definitely not,0,Lounge
I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans  flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!,1,Blouses
Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.,0,Pants
Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,0,Sleep
This dress is very pretty  versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up  i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite  this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top),1,Dresses
I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online  but when i received mine  they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange  then more orange!!! i like orange  but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not  mostly orange on both front legs  the back of the legs have more color blocking  but barely any of the light lavender color,0,Lounge
This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!,0,Lounge
"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there",0,Dresses
I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses  but when i got this in the mail  it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!,1,Skirts
Runs almost two sizes small. i plan to wear as a jacket over a sleeveless dress / skirt / trousers like a suit. the material is sturdy. i recommend for early autumn or spring weather. once again  a collector's item with unique colors and design of pattern.,1,Outerwear
