This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too  but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!,1,Blouses

The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru  though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.,0,Dresses
I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference  i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.,1,Knits
I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,0,Knits
I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,0,Shorts
This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .,0,Blouses
I understand this is a pencil skirt  so it's gonna be more body hugging. however  this really did seem to run small. i only tried it on because it was on sale and there was a promotion. my thoughts below: ___________ pros: - great design that will match with a lot of things. - very soft and comfortable overall due to being part modal. lots of stretch. - no dry cleaning here. hand wash  which is a plus for me. - it's a thicker knit  but it's breathable  too. no issues with being see-through. - re,1,Skirts
First off  the moment i put on  i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall  xs was a good alternative to medium petite.,1,Sweaters
I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin  and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.,1,Knits
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",0,Jeans
"I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid",0,Dresses
"I'm about 5'5"" and normally about 120 lbs so i purchased the small. i'm currently 9 months prego  but i couldn't resist this jacket! i purchased anyway and although it doesn't fit over my belly right now  i'm looking forward to being able to wear it soon! it will be perfect for the chilly office or a casual day. the fabric is beautiful with just the right amount of stretch. like others have said  it has a bit of a navy-ish tint to to it  so it's not truly black. thanks retailer for offering anothe",1,Jackets
This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.,0,Knits
This dress really was huge  and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft  but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is.,0,Dresses
"It's not totally apparent in all of the photos  but this dress does have a very noticeable a-symmetric hemline. i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is ""forgiving"" and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame. if you are truly an hourglass (small waist  larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight ) this dress is a poor choice. the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip  and the a-symmetry of this particular hemline not only draws",0,Dresses
"The material is soft (maybe not the best quality) and the cut is easy to wear. i have both colors and love them...they wash nicely and i like the ""baseball"" cut at the bottom. i especially like the print at the neck line...very cute and feminine.",1,Knits
Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.,0,Dresses
The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.,0,Pants
I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.,0,Knits
This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery  beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'2 and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said  you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth,1,Dresses
"I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup  smallish in other proportions (125  5'6"") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?",0,Knits
I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror  it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however  that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself  but at 48  i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!,0,Knits
Awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed,0,Dresses
I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,0,Jeans
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!,0,Blouses
Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!,0,Knits
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,0,Knits
There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a,0,Dresses
I found this top to be very beautiful and well made. the fabric is on the lighter side  however for me that is a double plus. it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top. and going towards spring it extends wearing time. the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater. it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities. i found it runs very true to size. i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t,1,Lounge
I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.,0,Sweaters
This vest is so cute and flattering. these pictures don't do it justice. you must see it in person and try it on. it only has a small percentage of wool in it  so it could easily be worn in the spring/summer with a tank.,1,Sweaters
I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.,0,Dresses
I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft  but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front  so if you have a larger chest  you end up looking like a football player.  i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest  this would be very flattering.,0,Knits
The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.,0,Knits
"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun  and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also  not as comfortable as they looked  the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me  though the pants were in the correct size.",0,Lounge
I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.,0,Jeans
"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top  but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.  i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.  a great staple for your closet.",1,Knits
This vest is adorable! i love the color  it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great  some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly  i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall  but it works perfectly with my build.,1,Jackets
This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t,0,Dresses
"Retailer  please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11"" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable.",0,Pants
I usually wear a medium in jackets  took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well  the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin  will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase  would buy again.,1,Sweaters
I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it  although probably comfortable  not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture  in person.,0,Dresses
The stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.,0,Blouses
Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!,1,Blouses
When i walked into my local retailer  two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways  and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out  but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.,1,Knits

I ordered this style in the blue  red  yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size  matching the model's photos. but  the quality is poor. the hems are frayed  they wrinkle easily  they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t,0,Knits
Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned  it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra  i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry  but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow,1,Dresses
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.,1,Knits

If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then  it's surprisingly fun to wear.,0,Skirts
"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso  almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition  they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame  they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.",1,Pants
I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really  nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am  5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it  would have ruined the details of the dress. they were  backordered on petites in my size  so  i just returned it.,1,Dresses

I ordered this in carbon for store pick up  and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer  and went well with pencil skirts  flare pants  etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big  sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me  but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...,1,Knits

I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!,0,Knits
Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,1,Intimates
First  i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short  because  well  it is. that being said  it is a perfect length for someone who is petite  like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets  which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size  is wonderfully warm and cozy  and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :),1,Jackets
This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!  i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!  i wish they had other colors!!!!!!,1,Blouses
A beautiful blouse;however  i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also  and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.,0,Blouses
Great idea  but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked  but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price  it did not justify a place in my closet?,0,Blouses
This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely  is a gorgeous color  feels soft  and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand  but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!,1,Fine gauge
After the reviews about sizing  i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly  the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said  the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big  it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide  crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the,0,Blouses
I absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online  but unfortunately  it just didn't fit right. the bust and bodice not designed for curves  and the dress just didn't fit correctly  i think it would work better on very slim figures.,0,Dresses

"This sweater is super flattering. love the cowl neck and longer length. it is not boxy or shapeless  but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere. i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted.  i purchased the navy and think i'll go back for the brown as well!  size down if between sizes.  i am 5'7"" and busty  and the medium fit great.",1,Sweaters
I definitely agree with the other reviews  however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up  or down  as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6  or 8 (28/29)  and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants  so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store  but worth it!,1,Skirts

This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color  casual. fit me like all the retailer size  8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.,1,Skirts

I bought this is in the gray color  although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said  and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it  giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.,1,Sweaters

I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.,0,Knits

I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0,Pants

This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does!

Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.,1,Swim
Tried both colors....gorgeous  but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe. happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is.

Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s  but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school)  and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings  but its not too bulky so i can keep it on,1,Lounge
I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.,0,Dresses

"Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference.",1,Jeans
This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.,0,Knits

Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,0,Skirts

This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).,1,Lounge

This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette  so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i'm hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand  and,1,Jackets

The shirt fits nice and has a classic cut. i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone. the shirt is soft and comfortable  but is rather thin and see through. the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas. wouldn't pay full price for it  but it's worth it on sale.,1,Knits
This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose  and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4  32dd  waist 27 and 130 lbs.,1,Dresses

I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable)  but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th,0,Jeans

Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top,0,Lounge
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,0,Sweaters

I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,0,Dresses

I love this sweatshirt! i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect. the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closet...and it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroidery...funny how 2 pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li,1,Trend

As with many of retailer's tops these days  there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well  though. the white color is cream  which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body  order down a size!,0,Knits
The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!,1,Knits

I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly  there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.,0,Dresses

"In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this.",0,Blouses
"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",1,Blouses

"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top  but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer  so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.",1,Knits
The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.,1,Skirts
Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,0,Fine gauge
This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.,0,Knits
I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...,0,Blouses

I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so  if you want a more tailored  but loose fit  then size down.     but  it isn't boxy. and  the deep v is sexy  but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk  but it's just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability  like when you drive. there isn't much pull.     it's a thin light material and very cool for hot  humid summer,1,Knits

I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online  but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs  i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering.,1,Blouses

I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium  even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.,1,Knits

I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy  so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus  even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily  with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.,1,Dresses
I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however  the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy  but still a gorgeous top!,0,Blouses

I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but  i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately  it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal,1,Dresses
I actually rather like this top  i ordered a size smaller than usual  based on how flowy it looks in the picture  and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich  and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it  and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot  but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material  so of course  it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also  there was no petite in the pink  so can't comment on,1,Blouses

I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.,0,Blouses

First off  this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt  but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear  but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut  you could wear it oversized without it drowning you  or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia,1,Knits

First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,0,Trend
First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.,0,Blouses
I do a lot of online shopping and  consequently  a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant  nice and airy. when the shirt arrived  i almost thought that i should return it  because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in  you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt  because it's extremely comfortable  and i still get a lot of complimen,1,Knits
I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute  but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this  it is baggy and loose. however  probably due to the elastic at the bottom  this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference  i am 5'6 115  a,1,Knits

It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible ,0,Dresses

Just received this in the mail  tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l  but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch)  in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy  stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me,1,Knits
The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......,0,Blouses

I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.,0,Skirts

I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.,0,Lounge

The photos do an amazing job of selling this coat. in person it is just a little bit less than what i was hoping for. the navy blue color is lovely and elegant and fits the sophisticated femininity of this style. black or khaki would be too boring.  the fabric is soft and drapes and flows beautifully  but it is quite thin. if you hold the coat up to the light you can almost see through it! the thinness probably helps the flattering fit of the coat  but i don't know how effective that makes it at,1,Outerwear
This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist,0,Dresses

I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly  it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer  colors are brighter/better in person.,1,Blouses

Like the reviewers before me  this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress.     that being said  it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50's style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however  because it is a fulle,1,Dresses

I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.,0,Knits

The embroidery grabbed my attention  but i loved the way it felt once i tried it on. the fit is loose (i'm between a small and medium and the small was a bit loose)  but still flattering. i really love everything about it  even the lighter weight fabric. i live in the south were fall and winter tend to be on the warmer side. the v-neck is just perfect. i can see wearing this to work as well as out - one of the most versatile dresses i've found lately!,1,Dresses

This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large  however  so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible.,1,Knits
"This top is beautiful  the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly  slimming. but  a word to the wise  the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size 0 with an narrow back/chest and shoulders. i can't imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this. i am 5'5""  145 lbs and a 34b and always a small or medium and a size 6 for reference. i",1,Knits

I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect  i'm happy with the purchase  and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however  i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck  but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed  there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother ,0,Knits

Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.,0,Dresses

I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.,0,Dresses
I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older,0,Dresses

I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size)  i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy. disappoin,0,Knits

Fyi-the model is wearing the top with a cami tank under. on it's own  it's lace and has holes throughout. i prefer it that way  so you can layer to make it more conservative  but also wear with a nude bra for an edgier look. material washed well and has a pretty raw lace edge seam on the bottom!,1,Knits

"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was  i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",0,Dresses

"This top had potential  but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7""  135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy  but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves  but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute  but thi",0,Knits
Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist  which i like. however  now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).,1,Skirts
For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.,1,Dresses
This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.,0,Dresses
"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav",0,Knits
